Anyone who's ready to sign up for Medicare has a lot of decisions to make. But one decision is especially important: Should you choose Medicare Advantage or use Medigap to supplement your Original Medicare plan?
Key Takeaways
- Traditional Medicare provides good basic health coverage, but it pays only about 80% of approved costs for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures and usually doesn't cover prescription drug costs or such things as routine dental care.
- Medigap supplemental insurance plans are designed to fill Medicare Part A and Part B coverage gaps.
- To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance) within the seven-month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
- You can choose to get your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits through a Medicare Advantage plan. They often include benefits beyond Part A and Part B. Private, Medicare-approved health insurance companies offer these plans.
- Although Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is optional, if you don’t get it as either as a stand-alone plan or as part of a Medicare Advantage plan, there may be financial penalties if you need to buy a policy later on because you need expensive drugs.
- Consider plan costs, plan doctors, convenience, your lifestyle and travel plans, your health, and any additional benefits in making your Medicare coverage choices.
Medicare Coverage
Budgeting for healthcare costs in retirement is tough since there’s usually no way of knowing whether your expenses each year will be minimal or huge. While traditional Medicare (Part A and Part B) provides good basic coverage, it pays only about 80% of the costs it approves for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. The other 20% of the bill is the individual’s responsibility and—unlike coverage under the Affordable Care Act—there is no cap on the amount a person might have to pay in one year.
Let's say, for example, that you need heart bypass surgery. The cost would be a minimum of $85,891, according to the American Heart Association , and you would be responsible for a co-pay of $17,178—or much more if there are complications or something else goes wrong. In addition, some health needs, such as prescription drugs, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and dental care, are not covered at all by regular Medicare (Part A and Part B).
There are two basic ways for recipients to fill most of these coverage gaps and reduce the risk of tremendous bills in a bad health year:
Medicare Plus Medigap Supplemental Insurance Policies
About two-thirds of the 61 million seniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries choose traditional Medicare, Parts A and B, which cover hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. About 80% of these beneficiaries supplement their insurance with Medigap (Medicare Supplement) insurance, Medicaid, employer-sponsored insurance, and/or stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies.
Medicare Supplement insurance plans are not connected with or endorsed by the U.S. government or the federal Medicare program.
While this may be the more expensive option, it has a few advantages. Both Medicare and Medigap insurance plans cover you for any hospital or doctor in the U.S. that accepts Medicare, and the great majority do. There is no need for prior authorization or a referral from a primary care doctor. Coverage includes the entire U.S., which may be important for those who travel frequently or spend part of the year in a different locale. This option is also attractive to those who have particular physicians and hospitals they want to use.
Medicare Advantage Plans
Available from private, Medicare-approved insurance companies, Medicare Advantage policies (Part C) are marketed to consumers under such names as Aetna, Humana, and Kaiser Foundation Medicare plans. They may have no premium or a lower one compared to the significant premiums for Medigap and prescription drug insurance policies. Medicare Advantage plans cover hospitals and doctors and often also include prescription drug coverage and some services not covered by Medicare. A little more than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries choose one of these plans.
Most Medicare Advantage plans operate as health maintenance organization (HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO) insurance. HMOs limit members to using the doctors and hospitals in their networks. PPOs generally let members get care outside the plan's network, but members may have to pay more for such care. Some plans require prior authorization for specialist care or procedures, and/or a referral from a primary care doctor. Plans might not cover care given outside of the network’s geographical area. Extra benefits not covered by regular Medicare, such as eyeglasses, routine dental care, or gym memberships, may be offered.
When to Sign Up for Medicare
As you approach age 65, it’s important to know which enrollment deadlines apply to your circumstances to avoid costly fines and gaps in coverage. Begin by checking on your eligibility. To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospitals) and Part B (doctors) in the seven month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
If you currently get Social Security, you will be automatically enrolled; if not, you need to sign up either online or at your Social Security office.
Medicare Part B
If you are working at age 65, however, and you have employer insurance through a company with more than 20 employees, you have the right to stay on your employer insurance and delay signing up for Medicare Part B until your employer coverage ends. If you work for an employer with fewer than 20 employees, it is very important to ask the employer whether you are required to sign up for Medicare and get that decision in writing.
Medicare Part D
You need to be signed up for Medicare Parts A and B before you can enroll in a Medicare Advantage (Part C) plan. Once you’ve enrolled in Medicare, a key decision point is choosing coverage for Part D prescription drug insurance. If you don’t enroll in Part D insurance when you start Medicare and want to buy drug coverage later on, you may be permanently penalized for signing up late.
You can avoid the penalty, however, if you have what's known as creditable prescription drug coverage, which is prescription drug coverage (from an employer or union, for example) that’s expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. If you have this kind of drug coverage when you become eligible for Medicare, you are generally allowed to keep it. You generally won't have to pay a penalty if you later decide to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and you haven't gone for longer than 63 continuous days without creditable coverage.
Many Medicare Advantage plans include Part D drug insurance, but a stand-alone policy can also be purchased for those who choose regular Medicare (Part A and Part B) or a Medicare Advantage plan that doesn’t include Part D.
Choosing Traditional Medicare Plus a Medigap Plan
Regular or traditional Medicare comprises Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance). You can supplement this coverage with a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and a Medigap supplemental insurance plan. While signing up for Medicare gets you into Parts A and B, you have to take action on your own to buy these supplemental policies.
Finding Part D, Drug Insurance
To get started, find the plans available in your zip code. Once you have created an account at Medicare.gov, you can enter the names of your drugs and use a convenient tool that allows you to compare plan premiums, deductibles, and Medicare star ratings.
If you don’t take many (or any) prescription drugs, look for a plan with a low monthly premium. All plans must still cover most drugs used by people with Medicare. If, on the other hand, you have high prescription drug costs, check into plans that cover your drugs in the donut hole, the coverage gap period that kicks in after you and the plan have spent $4,020 on covered drugs in 2020.
Selecting a Medigap (supplemental) Plan: Recent Changes Limit Choices
Medigap policies are private plans, available from insurance companies or through brokers, but not on medicare.gov. They are labeled Plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, each with a different standardized coverage set. Some plans include emergency medical benefits during foreign travel. Since coverage is standard, there are no ratings of Medigap policies. Consumers can confidently compare insurer’s prices for each letter plan and simply choose the better deal.
As of Jan. 1, 2020, Medigap plans sold to new Medicare beneficiaries aren't allowed to cover the Part B deductible.
Until recently, most people (66%) who bought Medigap policies chose Plan F, which gave the most comprehensive coverage, including paying for the Medicare Part B deductible ($198 in 2020).12 However, in an effort to trim Medicare expenses, Congress suspended Plans C and F for people who become Medicare-eligible in 2020 and beyond.
Plan D and Plan G have similar benefits to Plan C and Plan F, except for not covering the Part B deductible. People who signed up or became eligible for Medicare before 2020 can purchase or continue Plans C or F, though prices may rise and it may be a better deal to switch to a plan that doesn’t cover the deductible.
Choosing a Medicare Advantage Plan
Medicare Advantage Health Plans are similar to private health insurance. Most services, such as office visits, lab work, surgery, and many others, are covered after a small co-pay. Plans might offer an HMO or PPO network and all plans place a yearly limit on total out-of-pocket expenses. Each plan has different benefits and rules. Most provide prescription drug coverage. Some require a referral to see a specialist while others won’t. Some may pay a portion of out-of-network care, while others will cover only doctors and facilities that are in the HMO or PPO network. There are also other types of Medicare Advantage plans.
Selecting a plan with a low or no annual premium can be important. But its also essential to check on co-pay and coinsurance costs, especially for expensive hospital stays and procedures, to estimate your possible annual expenses. Since care is often limited to in-network physicians and hospitals, the quality and size of a particular plan’s network should be an important factor in your choice.
Head to the Find a Medicare plan page at medicare.gov where the compare feature allows you to look at plans side by side. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), an insurance rating organization, also compares what consumers think of Medicare Advantage plan’s services and physicians, and whether the plans meet certain quality standards. Top ratings in 2019 were garnered by an impressive 43 Aetna Medicare Advantage plans sold in 37 states plus the District of Columbia. Other companies with highly-rated Medicare Advantage plans included: Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Humana, Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, and United Healthcare. Be sure to check the ratings for plans available in your state.
What to Consider in Making Your Choice
Your lifestyle, health condition, and finances may all influence whether traditional Medicare plus Medigap or Medicare Advantage is best for you. Here are some things to consider:
The Costs
Medicare Advantage plans might save you money, but be sure to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll need to buy a separate Part D plan if you want that coverage. Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and whether there are any limits in their coverage. If extra benefits are included, such as help with hearing aids and dental bills, be sure to find out how much of these expenses will actually be covered.
Compare these costs to those of purchasing Medigap and stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies. Calculate the premiums, as well as the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance) the policies may require. Yes, these can be complex calculations, but an insurance broker can help by doing the math for you and making cost-saving recommendations.
Choice of Doctors
Traditional Medicare allows you to use any U.S. doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare, and most do. Most Medicare Advantage plans restrict you to using physicians in their network and may cover less, or none, of the expenses of using out-of-network and out-of-town providers.
A plus of Medicare Advantage managed care plans is that care is coordinated and your primary care doctor will be in the loop about the findings of specialists. With traditional Medicare you don’t need a referral to see a specialist or a prior authorization for procedures, but you’ll need to make sure care is coordinated and your doctors are in communication with one another. Often this is best done by developing a relationship with a primary care physician and letting them refer you to specialists.
Local Conditions and Convenience
In some areas where physicians and hospitals are scarce, it’s important to check out both the networks of available Medicare Advantage plans and the locations of providers who accept regular Medicare. Are the doctors accepting new patients? Will you have to travel far to see a provider or be treated at an emergency room? Advice from local professionals, neighbors, and licensed insurance brokers can help you find Medicare Advantage plans that do business in your area. Compare plans to find one that may suit your needs.
Lifestyle Factors
Frequent travel, dual residences, and currently having physicians whom you would like to keep are some of the factors that may make regular Medicare a good choice. Ask your current physicians if they participate in any Medicare Advantage plans and/or accept regular Medicare. For frequent fliers, choosing regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance policy that covers emergency care in foreign countries may be a good bet. Similarly, people who spend part of the year in a different geographical area may find it difficult to stay in network for medical care and might be better off with regular Medicare and a Medigap insurance policy.
Your Health
People with chronic diseases and those who develop a serious health condition should look deeper into the choices available. A Medicare Advantage plan may be a better choice if it has an out-of-pocket maximum that protects you from huge bills. Regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance plan generally allows you more choice in where you receive your care. Check whether any expensive drugs or equipment (such as supplies for people with diabetes) will be covered by your Medicare prescription drug plan, whether it's a stand-alone one or part of a Medicare Advantage plan.
Broader Benefits
Medicare Advantage plans are in the throes of change as the government allows insurers to add coverage for items that are not included in regular Medicare. These include such things as supplying food for service animals; paying for ramps for wheelchairs, hold bars, and indoor air quality monitors; adult day care; and residential and in-home respite care. Many of these benefits are just being initiated, so it pays to reconsider your choice of regular Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage each year during open enrollment to make sure you’re getting the benefits you need most, whether it's home care or transportation to doctors.
Can You Switch? Yes, But There’s a Catch
It’s logical to consider enjoying the cost savings of a Medicare Advantage plan while you’re relatively healthy, and then switching back to regular Medicare if you develop a condition you want treated at an out-of-town facility. In fact, switching between the two forms of Medicare (or between Medicare Advantage plans) is an option for everyone during the open enrollment period in the fall. This Annual Election Period runs from October 15 - December 7 each year.
Here’s the catch. If you switch back to regular Medicare (Part A and Part B), you may not be able to sign up for a Medigap insurance policy. When you first sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B, Medigap insurance companies are generally obligated to sell you a policy, regardless of your medical condition. But in subsequent years they may have the right to charge you extra due to your age and preexisting conditions, or not to sell you a policy at all if you have serious medical problems. Some states have enacted laws to address this. In New York and Connecticut, for example, Medigap insurance plans are guaranteed-issue year-round, while California, Massachusetts, Maine, Missouri, and Oregon have all set aside annual periods in which switching is allowed. If you live in a state that doesn't have this protection, planning to switch between the systems depending on your health condition is a risky business.
The CARES Act of 2020
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package, called the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act, into law. It expands Medicare's ability to cover treatment and services for those affected by COVID-19. The CARES Act also:
- Increases flexibility for Medicare to cover telehealth services.
- Authorizes Medicare certification for home health services by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse specialists.
- Increases Medicare payments for COVID-19-related hospital stays and durable medical equipment.
For Medicaid, the CARES Act clarifies that non-expansion states can use the Medicaid program to cover COVID-19-related services for uninsured adults who would have qualified for Medicaid if the state had chosen to expand. Other populations with limited Medicaid coverage are also eligible for coverage under this state option.",Medigap,2
2,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medigap-insurance.asp,"What Is Medigap Insurance?
Also called Medicare Supplement Insurance, Medigap is health insurance coverage provided by private companies designed to pay for costs not covered by Original Medicare. Depending on which plan you get, these costs might include copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles, as well as services Original Medicare doesn't cover, such as travel outside of the U.S.
Key Takeaways
- You can buy Medigap insurance from a private insurance company to pay for costs not covered by Original Medicare.
- There are 12 standardized Medigap plans approved by the federal government.
- Medigap plans don't cover the costs of prescription drugs—for that, you need to get a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (Part D).
- You can buy Medigap during an open enrollment period after you turn 65.
- Your insurance company can't cancel the policy if premiums are paid, even if the you experience health problems.
Understanding Medigap Insurance
Original Medicare—defined as Part A and B—will not cover all expenses associated with an illness. Medigap policies are designed to cover all or a portion of those extra charges depending on the type of coverage, but generally don’t include long-term care, vision, dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, or private nursing.
Although private insurance companies offer Medigap coverage, the federal government requires companies to offer standardized policies. Your 12 choices are plans A, B, C, D, F, F-High Deductible, G, G-High Deductible, K, L, M, and N.
However, for those who become newly eligible for Medicare in 2020 and after, plans C, F, and F-High Deductible are no longer available. That’s because these plans cover the Medicare Part B deductible, the amount you have to pay before coverage kicks in, which is $198 in 2020.
The Medigap policy covers coinsurance only after you've paid the deductible (unless the Medigap policy also pays the deductible).
Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) in 2015, which disallowed such coverage. The intention was to make people pay at least a little bit for health care to prevent them from running straight to the doctor for every scrape, scratch, or sniffle. Fortunately, those who are already enrolled in plans C, F, and F-High Deductible will be able to keep them going forward. In addition, people eligible for Medigap before Jan. 1, 2020 who did not enroll in a plan may still be able to buy them.
Requirements for Medigap Coverage
Monthly premiums for a Medigap policy are paid to a private insurance company that is licensed to sell such policies in your state and can be paid in addition to the monthly premium paid to Part B of Medicare. The policy only covers one person. So, if you and your spouse want coverage, you each need a separate Medigap policy.
Furthermore, according to Medicare.gov,
“The best time to buy a Medigap policy is during your six-month Medigap open enrollment period. During that time you can buy any Medigap policy sold in your state, even if you have health problems. This period automatically starts the month you’re 65 and are enrolled in Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance). After this enrollment period, you may not be able to buy a Medigap policy. If you’re able to buy one, it may cost more.""
Shopping for Medigap coverage is straightforward because you merely compare prices and the suitability of the insurance company. Once you have a Medigap policy, it is guaranteed renewable, even if you have health problems. In other words, the insurance company cannot cancel the policy so long as premiums are paid.
Importantly, Medigap coverage does not work with a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C). Indeed, if you have a Medicare Advantage Plan, it is illegal for someone to sell you Medigap coverage. However, if you have Medicare Advantage and are unhappy with the plan, you can switch to Original Medicare within the first 12 months, at which point you can buy Medigap coverage.

A Medigap policy is health insurance sold by private insurance companies to fill the “gaps” in Original Medicare Plan coverage. Medigap policies help pay some of the health care costs that the Original Medicare Plan doesn't cover. If you are in the Original Medicare Plan and have a Medigap policy, then Medicare and your Medigap policy will each pay its share of covered health care costs.
Generally, when you buy a Medigap policy you must have Medicare Part A and Part B. You will have to pay the monthly Medicare Part B premium. In addition, you will have to pay a premium to the Medigap insurance company. As long as you pay your premium, your Medigap policy is guaranteed renewable. This means it is automatically renewed each year. Your coverage will continue year after year as long as you pay your premium. In some states, insurance companies may refuse to renew a Medigap policy bought before 1992.
Insurance companies can only sell you a “standardized” Medigap policy. Medigap policies must follow Federal and state laws. These laws protect you. The front of a Medigap policy must clearly identify it as “Medicare Supplement Insurance.”
It's important to compare Medigap policies, because costs can vary. The standardized Medigap policies that insurance companies offer must provide the same benefits. Generally, the only difference between Medigap policies sold by different insurance companies is the cost.
You and your spouse must buy separate Medigap policies.Your Medigap policy won't cover any health care costs for your spouse.
Some Medigap policies also cover other extra benefits that aren't covered by Medicare.
You are guaranteed the right to buy a Medigap policy under certain circumstances.

- You can buy Medigap coverage in any state.
- There are gaps in Medigap coverage.
- Medigap plans that cover the Part B deductible can no longer be purchased by newly-eligible enrollees.
- Medigap insurers set their prices three ways.
- Some Medigap carriers offer discounts.
- The best time to purchase a Medigap policy begins on the first day of the month in which you turn 65 and have enrolled in Medicare A and B.
- An insurer can’t make you wait for Medigap coverage to start.
Because Original Medicare covers a significant portion of its recipients’ healthcare expenses, eligibility for Medicare is a welcome milestone. But for all that Medicare covers, its enrollees learn quickly that Original Medicare doesn’t pick up the tab for everything.
What is Medicare supplement insurance?
Medicare enrollees typically find that they need help with many Medicare expenses – including copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles, in addition to any medical expenses incurred during travel outside the United States and its territories. To cover those expenses, millions of people – more than a third of all Original Medicare beneficiaries – purchase Medicare supplement insurance, also known as Medigap. These plans are designed to fill in the gaps in Medicare and limit enrollees’ out-of-pocket exposure.
Where can you buy Medigap coverage?
Medigap policies are available in every state, from private health insurance carriers. America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) reported in 2019 that total Medigap enrollment in 2017 stood at 13.5 million – up from 11.6 million in 2014.
All Medigap insurers must abide by strict state and federal laws. In most states, Medigap carriers must offer standardized policies that are identified by the letters “A” through “N.” There are a total of ten different plan designs: A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, and although the price varies from one carrier to another, the plan benefits are the same from one state to another and from one carrier to another, within each letter. (As described below, Plans C and F are no longer available to newly eligible enrollees.) So all plan Gs, for example, offer the same benefits — regardless of where you live or what insurance carrier you use. (Medigap policies in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are standardized in a different way.)
In some states, not all types of Medigap coverage will be available. In other states, you may be able to purchase Medicare SELECT – a Medigap policy that requires plan holders to use specific hospitals and, in some cases, specific doctors. Any of the ten Medigap plan designs can be offered as a Medicare SELECT plan, and they tend to be less expensive than typical Medigap policies due to the restricted network. If you choose a Medicare SELECT plan and use a provider that’s not in the network, your Medigap plan won’t pick up your Medicare out-of-pocket costs unless it’s an emergency.
It’s important to note that insurance companies offering Medigap policies are not required to offer every Medigap policy. However, if a carrier offers any Medigap policy, it is required to also offer at least Medigap Plan A, as well as either Plan D or Plan G if the enrollee is new to Medicare, and either Plan C or Plan F if the enrollee became eligible for Medicare prior to 2020.
Are there gaps in Medigap coverage?
Yes. Medigap plans are designed to cover some or all of the out-of-pocket expenses for services that Medicare covers. But they do not cover care that’s not covered at all by Medicare. The list of expenses that Medigap policies don’t cover includes long-term care in a nursing home, vision and dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, private-duty nursing care, or prescription drugs. (Plans purchased prior to 2006 were allowed to cover prescriptions, and if you’ve still got one of those plans, you’re allowed to keep it. But Medigap plans sold since 2006 cannot include prescription coverage.)
Also, Medigap policies aren’t compatible with the following types of coverage:
- employer or union plans; veterans’ benefits;
- Indian health services;
- Medicare Advantage plans;
- Medicare prescription drug plans (you’ll need a prescription drug plan in addition to the Medigap policy, since they cover different things.); and
- Medicaid.
Finally, Medigap policies are for individuals only – not for couples or families. So if you and your spouse are both eligible for Medicare, you’ll each need to select an individual Medigap plan. (Some carriers offer a discount if both spouses select the same plan.)
Can new beneficiaries buy Medigap plans that cover the Part B deductible?
There are two Medigap plan designs – Plan F and Plan C – that cover the Medicare Part B deductible. As a result of HR2 (MACRA), which was signed into law in 2015, those plans are no longer available to people who weren’t already eligible for Medicare prior to 2020.
People who were already enrolled in Plan C and Plan F can keep their coverage. And people who were Medicare-eligible prior to the start of 2020 can still apply for Plan C or Plan F. (If they’re outside of their initial enrollment window, carriers will likely use medical underwriting to determine eligibility.)
But people who become eligible for Medicare in 2020 or beyond can no longer purchase Plan C or Plan F. The idea was to eliminate first-dollar coverage under Medigap plans in an effort to prevent over-utilization of healthcare (ie, ensure that enrollees have some “skin in the game” rather than having all of their costs covered by Medicare and supplemental coverage). So people who become eligible for Medicare in 2020 or later can still buy Medigap plans that cover nearly all of their out-of-pocket costs for Medicare-covered services, but they will have to pay the Part B deductible on their own if and when they need outpatient care.
As of 2020, the Part B deductible is $198. (The Part B deductible is a per-year charge, as Medicare’s benefit periods only apply to inpatient care under Medicare Part A.)
How do Medigap insurers set their prices?
The cost of a Medigap policy can vary with each insurance company. There are three ways in which insurers set Medigap rates:
- With community-rated pricing, enrollees are charged the same premium regardless of age. So a 65-year-old enrollee will pay the same premium as an 85-year-old enrollee. Premiums can change over time, but they change by the same amount for all enrollees. There are eight states that require all Medigap plans to be community rated.
- Issue-age-rated premiums are based on the age of the purchaser. So the older the person is at the time of purchase, the higher the premium, and that difference continues as long as they have the plan. For plans with this rating structure, it’s particularly important to enroll as soon as you’re eligible for Medicare coverage, because your premium will always be as low as possible that way.
- With attained-age-rated pricing, the premium goes up as the insured person ages. These plans might be the least expensive option when you’re first eligible for coverage, since you’ll be among the youngest enrollees. But as you get older, the price will increase based on your age as well as factors like inflation and overall medical cost trends.
Be aware that Medigap plans in most states are only guaranteed issue during the six-month window that starts the month you turn 65 (or when you enroll in Medicare Part B, which might be after you turn 65 if you still had employer-sponsored coverage), and during limited special enrollment periods. There’s no annual open enrollment period like there is for Medicare Advantage, Medicare D, and Original Medicare.
If you don’t enroll during your initial enrollment period, you may have to pay a higher premium – or be declined altogether – if you’re in poor health, as carriers are allowed to use medical underwriting after your initial enrollment period has passed.
How can I pay less for Medigap coverage?
Make sure you enroll as soon as you’re eligible, in order to get coverage that’s guaranteed issue with no premium rate-ups based on your medical history.
Some Medigap carriers offer discounts that might apply to you. Some insurers offer discounts for women, non-smokers, married people, and for paying annually. States also offer a health insurance assistance program, providing up-to-date Medigap insurance information and a list of qualified private insurers. Check our state pages to find your state’s assistance program.
Is there a best time to purchase a Medigap policy?
The best window of time in which to buy a Medigap policy begins on the first day of the month in which you’re at least 65 and enrolled in Medicare A and B (you have to be enrolled in both Medicare A and B in order to get a Medigap plan). This is the start of your initial enrollment period, and it lasts for six months. Under federal rules, Medigap coverage in every state is guaranteed during this window.
If you’re eligible for Medicare because of a disability, the majority of the states offer at least some sort of guaranteed issue enrollment periods for those under 65. (In many cases the coverage is more expensive for those under 65. You can click on your state on this map to see how the rules work.) So it pays to research your state’s health care regulations. (Contact your state SHIP office or Department of Insurance for more details).
If you wait to buy a policy until after your initial enrollment period, your carrier generally has the option of denying the application or charging a higher premium based on the company’s underwriting requirements, as there is no federal requirement that Medigap plans be guaranteed-issue outside of the initial enrollment window and very limited special enrollment periods. But states can set their own regulations for Medigap plans:
- In New York and Connecticut, Medigap plans are not medically underwritten, regardless of when an applicant enrolls.
- In Massachusetts, there’s an annual guaranteed-issue Medigap open enrollment period each year, from February 1 through March 31.
- In Maine, Medigap insurers must designate one month each year when Plan A is guaranteed issue, regardless of the applicant’s medical history.
- Missouri‘s “anniversary rule” allows enrollees to switch from one Medigap insurer to another (as long as both plans are the same letter) on a guaranteed-issue basis during a window each year that extends for 30 days before and 30 days after the anniversary of when the plan was first purchased.
- In California and Oregon, Medigap enrollees have a 30-day window each year, following the enrollee’s birthday, when he or she can switch to any other available Medigap plan that has equal or lesser benefits, without medical underwriting.
- Washington State allows those already enrolled in Medigap plans to switch to another Medigap plan at any time, as long as they’ve had coverage for at least 90 days. Those with Medigap Plan A are limited to switching to only another Plan A. But people with Medigap Plans B through N can switch to any other Plan B through N.
Check with your state SHIP or your state’s Department of Insurance for more information about state-based regulations regarding Medigap.
Will I have to wait for my Medigap policy to take effect?
An insurer can’t make you wait for your coverage to start, but it can make you wait for coverage of a pre-existing condition – and may also refuse to cover your out-of-pocket costs for that pre-existing condition for up to six months during a pre-existing condition waiting period. That said, if you recently had “credible coverage” – or if you have guaranteed issue “Medigap protection” – you may be able to shorten or avoid entirely the waiting period.

Medigap is a supplemental insurance you can get on top of your Medicare Parts A & B. Medicare covers many healthcare costs, but it does not pay for every expense. You are responsible for these costs, sometimes called the “gaps” in Medicare coverage. Medigap helps pay for the gaps, much like retiree insurance.
What are the current gaps in Medicare?
How does Medigap work?
You can buy Medigap from private insurance companies in your state. There are 11 different standard Medigap plans that can be sold in most states. The 11 standard plans are labeled A-D, F, high-deductible F, G and K-N. Each of these plans covers different services. Starting in 2020, Plan C and Plan F (including high deductible F) can no longer be sold to newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries including those who turn 65 or become eligible due to disability or diagnosis (ESRD, ALS) on or after January 1, 2020.
These states have their own standardized plans you can buy.

What doctors can I see with Medigap?
With Medigap, you can see any doctor, whether the doctor accepts Medicare assignment or not.
- If your doctor “accepts assignment,” meaning he or she agrees to be paid the Medicare-approved amount for a service, your Medigap insurance company usually pays your doctor directly.
- If your doctor does not accept Medicare assignment, you may have to send claims to your insurance company and pay the doctor yourself.
Note, however, that Medigap plans generally do not pay for care received outside of the United States, except for medically necessary emergency care that occurs during the first 60 days of your trip.
Do you have a specific scenario and want to know your rights when buying a Medigap policy? Learn about your rights.
People who purchase a Medigap policy have certain rights:
- Free look periods
- Pre-existing condition wait periods
- Guaranteed issue rights
- Renewals
These rights can protect you from being denied coverage. They also can protect you from having to keep a plan that is not right for you. If you are thinking about buying a Medigap plan, or if you already have one, keep these tips in mind.
By law, when you buy a Medigap policy, you have a 30-day “free look” or trial period. If you change your mind within 30 days of the day your policy started, you can cancel it and get a refund.
If you are switching Medigap plans, do not cancel your first policy until after your free look period is up. You may have to pay two premiums for 1 month. But you will be able to change back to your first plan if you need to.
If you have a pre-existing condition and do not have a minimum of 6 months creditable coverage when you enroll in Medigap, your provider can impose a “pre-existing condition waiting period” and refuse to cover your prior medical conditions for up to 6 months. This period depends on how many months you did not have creditable coverage. Most forms of health coverage count as “creditable” if there is no break in coverage for more than 63 days.
A prior or pre-existing condition is a condition or illness you were diagnosed with or treated for before your new healthcare coverage began.
So, for example, if you had creditable coverage for only 2 months prior to enrolling in Medigap, your pre-existing wait period would be only 4 months, instead of the standard 6-month waiting period.
How do I avoid pre-existing condition wait periods?
The best way to avoid or shorten pre-existing condition waiting periods is to make sure that you:
- Do not have a lapse of current coverage for more than 63 days
- Confirm that your current policy qualifies as creditable coverage
- Enroll in Medigap as soon as you are eligible during your Open Enrollment Period
- Keep your current coverage until you have received confirmation from your new policy
In some situations, you have the right to buy a Medigap policy outside of your Medigap Open Enrollment Period. These rights are called “Medigap protections” or guaranteed issue rights because the law says that insurance companies must sell or “issue” you a Medigap policy even if you have health problems. And this way, if you lose your current insurance, such as coverage through your job or a Medicare Advantage plan, you get the chance again to buy a Medigap policy.
In most cases, you must buy your new Medigap plan within 63 days of the time your previous health coverage ends. In these cases, you will not have to wait to get covered.
As long as you pay your Medigap premium, the company renews your policy automatically each year. This means that your coverage continues year after year as long as you pay your bill. Your policy is what is called “guaranteed renewable.”
The rights in this section are from Federal law. Many states provide additional Medicare rights. Protect yourself by keeping copies of any letters, notices, emails and claim denials from your Medigap insurance company that have your name on them.
Get in contact with your state about Medigap rules and rights with the state insurance department locater. Contact your state.
Keep any postmarked envelopes that these papers came in. Also, keep any papers that prove the date you bought your new Medigap policy. You may need this paperwork later if you have a problem with your plan.
What is Medicare SELECT?
Medicare SELECT policies are sold in some states. They are like regular Medigap policies, with one exception: you may be required to use hospitals and doctors in their network, except in an emergency. A plan can choose to make any Medigap plan a Medicare SELECT plan. They often cost less than other Medigap policies.
What questions should I ask my state insurance department?
- Does the law require Medigap insurance companies to sell to people who are under age 65 and have disabilities?
- What is the most number of months a Medigap insurer can make me wait for coverage of a pre-existing condition?
- Are there Medicare SELECT policies in my state? If so, is my doctor in the provider network?
- Which companies are licensed to sell Medigap in my state?
- What plans are available to me (if I live in Massachusetts, Minnesota or Wisconsin)?
Once you purchase a Medigap plan, your first resource should be your Medigap insurance company. Check your plan’s benefits booklet for contact information to get details about coverage and rights.

En español | Medigap is also sometimes referred to as a Medicare supplemental insurance. A Medigap policy, sold by private insurance companies, can help pay some of the health care costs (“gaps”) Original Medicare doesn’t cover, such as Medicare deductibles, coinsurance and some extra benefits such as care when you travel outside the U.S. You have a one-time six-month Medigap open enrollment period that starts the first month you're 65 and enrolled in Part B. This period gives you a guaranteed right to buy any Medigap policy sold in your state regardless of your health status.
If you have Original Medicare and you buy a Medigap policy, Medicare will pay its share of the Medicare-approved amount for covered health care costs first. Then your Medigap policy pays its share of covered benefits. Every Medigap policy must follow federal and state laws designed to protect you, and it must be clearly identified as Medicare supplemental insurance. Insurance companies that sell Medigap can only sell you “standardized” Medigap policies, identified in most states by letters.
All Medigap plans offer the same basic benefits but some offer additional benefits. Plans identified by the same letter cover the same benefits regardless of what company sells it.
Note: In Massachusetts, Minnesota and Wisconsin, Medigap policies may be standardized in a different way.
Note: Types of coverage that are NOT Medigap plans are Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare prescription drug plans, employer or union plans, including Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), TRICARE, veterans benefits and long term care insurance.

7,https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-health-coverage-options/supplemental-insurance-for-original-medicare-medigaps/medigap-overview,"Medigaps are health insurance policies that offer standardized benefits to work with Original Medicare (not with Medicare Advantage). They are sold by private insurance companies. If you have a Medigap, it pays part or all of certain remaining costs after Original Medicare pays first. Medigaps may cover outstanding deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Medigaps may also cover health care costs that Medicare does not cover at all, like care received when travelling abroad. Remember, Medigaps only work with Original Medicare. If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan, you cannot buy a Medigap.
Depending on where you live and when you became eligible for Medicare, you have up to 10 different Medigap policies to choose from: A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N (policies in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and Minnesota have different names). Each policy offers a different set of standardized benefits, meaning that policies with the same letter name offer the same benefits. However, premiums can vary from company to company.
Note: People eligible for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020 cannot purchase Medigaps that pay for the Part B deductible. This includes Plan C and Plan F. If you became Medicare-eligible before this date, you will still be able to purchase Plan C or Plan F.
Before you buy a Medigap policy, be sure to do your research. Some steps you may wish to take include the following:
- Make sure you are eligible to purchase a Medigap. Remember that you can only have a Medigap if you have Original Medicare. If you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, Medigaps cannot be sold to you. There may be other Medigap eligibility requirements that apply to you, depending on the state in which you live.
- Learn when you have the right to buy a Medigap without restriction. There are federal protections for people over 65 to buy a Medigap in certain situations. Some states have additional protections for individuals under 65 or during other times.
- Once you decide you need a Medigap and know you are eligible to enroll, compare the different types of policies that exist. As mentioned above, there are 10 different standardized policies in most states, each covering a different range of Medicare cost-sharing.
- Learn how a Medigap covers prior medical conditions to know if any of your medical costs may be excluded from Medigap coverage. Depending on your circumstances, a Medigap can exclude coverage for prior medical conditions for a limited amount of time.
- Find out how Medigap premiums are priced so you can make cost comparisons. It is important to understand the ways that insurers set premiums to find the best deal for you.
- Have a list of questions to ask when shopping for a Medigap to remind you what you should consider. Buying a Medigap can be complicated, but using a set of written questions and asking for help when needed can help you stay organized and simplify the process.

If you are enrolled in Medicare Part A and B (Original Medicare), Medigap plans can help fill the coverage gaps in Medicare Part A and Part B. Medigap plans are sold by private insurance companies and are designed to assist you with out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductibles, copays and coinsurance) not covered by Parts A and B. These plans are available in all 50 states and can vary in premiums and enrollment eligibility. Medigap plans are standardized; however, all of the standardized plans may not be available in your area.
Costs
Limits and Considerations
Limits
Most of the time, Medigap coverage has no network limitations and is available anywhere that Medicare is accepted.
Things to Consider
- Some Medigap plans cover foreign travel emergency services.
- Once you are enrolled in a plan, it renews every year as long as you pay your premium and the plan is available.
Initial Enrollment Period
The Initial Enrollment Period is a limited window of time when you can enroll in Original Medicare (Part A and/or Part B) when you are first eligible. After you are enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, you can select other coverage options like a Medigap (Medicare Supplement) plan from approved private insurers. The best time to buy a Medigap policy is the six-month period that starts the first day of the month that you turn 65 or older and enrolled in Part B. After this period, your ability to buy a Medigap policy may be limited and it may be more costly. Each state handles things differently, but there are additional open enrollment periods in some cases.
Your Initial Enrollment Period is based on the month in which you turn 65. It begins three months before your birth month and extends until three months after your birth month.
Example: If you are born on June 18, 1952, your Initial Enrollment Period is from March 1, 2017 until September 30, 2017.
Your Initial Enrollment Period is based on when you began receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) disability benefits. It begins the 22nd month after you began receiving benefits and continues until the 28thmonth after you began receiving benefits.
Example: If you are began receiving disability benefits in January 2015, your Initial Enrollment Period is from November 1, 2016 until May 31, 2017.
How to Enroll
You must first enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B before joining a Medigap (Medicare Supplement) plan. Contact your local Blue Cross Blue Shield company for help choosing a Medigap (Medicare Supplement) plan and getting enrolled.
Open Enrollment Period
The open enrollment period for Medicare runs from October 15 through December 7 on an annual basis, however, this is not the case for individuals interested in Medigap (Medicare Supplement) coverage. The open enrollment period for a Medigap policy is the six-month period that starts the first day of the month that you turn 65 or older and enrolled in Part B. After this period, your ability to buy a Medigap policy may be limited and it may be more costly. Each state handles things differently, but there are additional open enrollment periods in some cases.
Note: Once you are enrolled in a Medigap (Medicare Supplement) plan, it renews every year as long as you pay your premium and the plan is available.",Medigap,9
9,https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-health-coverage-options/supplemental-insurance-for-original-medicare-medigaps/comparing-medigap-options,"Insurance companies may offer up to 10 different Medigap policies labeled A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M and N. Each lettered policy is standardized. This means that all policies labeled with the same letter have the same benefits, no matter which company provides them or their price. For example, Medigap policy A offered by company 1 provides exactly the same benefits as Medigap policy A offered by company 2. Companies are not required to offer all 10 standardized Medigap policies, meaning some may be unavailable in your state.
Note that Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin have different ways of standardizing Medigap policies. If you live in one of these states, please contact your, State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) or State Department of Insurance for more information on purchasing a Medigap policy.
Medigaps help pay certain Medicare costs, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copays. Medigaps do not help pay for Medicare premiums. All policies must offer the following basic benefits:
- Hospital coinsurance coverage
- 365 additional days of full hospital coverage
- Full or partial coverage for the 20% coinsurance for provider charges and other Part B services
- Full or partial coverage for the first three pints of blood you need each year
- Hospice coinsurance for drugs and respite care
Beyond these basic benefits, each standardized Medigap covers a different amount of your Medicare cost-sharing. Depending on which Medigap policy you choose, you can get coverage for additional expenses, including:
- Hospital deductible
- Skilled nursing facility coinsurance
- Part B deductible (Note: People eligible for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020 cannot purchase Medigaps that pay for the Part B deductible. See below for more information.)
- Emergency care outside the U.S.
- At-home recovery
- Preventive care that Medicare does not cover
- Excess physician’s charges (some Medigaps will pay the limiting charge, which is the amount above the Medicare-approved amount that non-participating doctors can charge).
Medigap policy A is often the least expensive, but it only covers the basic benefits listed above. Policies C and F are the most comprehensive, but they generally cost more. See the Medigap Plan Benefits Chart for a fuller explanation of what each policy covers. Please note that this information is only applicable to plans sold beginning June 1, 2010.
Medigap Plans C and F
Medigap Plans C and F are only available to you if you became eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020. This is because people eligible for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020 cannot purchase Medigaps that pay the Part B deductible.
If you became Medicare-eligible before this date, you will still be able to purchase Plan C or Plan F. If you were eligible for Medicare before this time but did not enroll, you will be able to purchase Plan C or Plan F as long as you are within your Medigap open enrollment period or have a guaranteed issue right once you enroll in Original Medicare. If you currently have Medigap Plan C or Plan F, you can continue to renew it from insurers in your state.
Policies sold before June 1, 2010
Keep in mind that policies sold today have slightly different benefits from those offered before June 1, 2010. Also, policies E, H, I, and J are no longer sold. If you bought your Medigap before June 1, 2010, and have a discontinued policy, you can keep it as long as you like. The insurance company must continue to renew the discontinued Medigap policy each year you wish to keep it.

Medigap (also called Medicare supplement insurance or Medicare supplemental insurance) refers to various private health insurance plans sold to supplement Medicare in the United States. Medigap insurance provides coverage for many of the co-pays and some of the co-insurance related to Medicare-covered hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health care, ambulance, durable medical equipment, and doctor charges. Medigap's name is derived from the notion that it exists to cover the difference or ""gap"" between the expenses reimbursed to providers by Medicare Parts A and B for the preceding named services and the total amount allowed to be charged for those services by the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). As of 2016, 34% of Medicare beneficiaries were covered by a Medigap policy.[1] Public-option Part C Medicare Advantage health plans and private employee retiree insurance provides a similar supplemental role for almost all other Medicare beneficiaries not dual eligible for Medicaid.
Eligibility[edit]
Medicare eligibility can start for Americans when they turn at least 64 years & 9 months old or upon retirement. Those with an disability, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), ALS or on Social Security disability for 24 months in a row may also qualify for early Medicare benefits. A person must be enrolled in both Part A and B of Medicare before they can enroll in a Medigap plan. Upon enrollment, Medicare enrollees become eligible for Medigap Open Enrollment. This period starts on the first day of the month one turns 65 & enrolled in Medicare Part B and lasts for 6 months. During this period, a person can buy any Medigap plan regardless of their health status (called ""Guaranteed Issue Rights"").
This is different than if someone is losing group coverage or retiring. When this occurs, the person is eligible to exercise his or her ""Guarantee Issue"" right. With a Medigap guarantee issue right, a person can buy a Medigap Plan A, B, C, F, K, or L that's sold by any insurance company in their state. In addition, the insurance company cannot deny or raise the premium due to past or current health conditions. Also, the insurance company must cover any pre-existing conditions. Instead of exercising the guarantee issue right, a person can opt to go through the underwriting process in order to buy a plan G or N. Once a person is outside their open enrollment period and or guarantee issue, they can change their Medigap plan, but they will be subject to health underwriting by the insurance company they are applying with. It is also important to know that monthly premiums apply, and plans may not be cancelled by the insurer for any reason other than non-payment of premiums/membership dues. Furthermore, a single Medigap plan may cover only one person but may offer spousal discounts. Finally, Medigap insurance is not compatible with a Medicare Advantage plan. You cannot have both a Medicare Supplement and a Medicare Advantage plan at the same time. You can only have a Medigap plan if you are still on Medicare Part A and Part B and have not replaced your coverage with a Medicare Advantage Part C coverage.
Medicare recipients under age 65[edit]
Recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits or patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are entitled to Medicare coverage regardless of age, but are not automatically entitled to purchase Medigap policies unless they are at least 65. Under federal law, insurers are not required to sell Medigap policies to people under 65, and even if they do, they may use medical screening. However, a slight majority of states require insurers to offer at least one kind of Medigap policy to at least some Medicare recipients in that age group. Of these states, 25 require that Medigap policies be offered to all Medicare recipients. In California, Massachusetts, and Vermont, Medigap policies are not available to end-stage ESRD patients.[2] Part D deductible will go up for about 20% of Americans to over $150.00 a year. That's close to a 50% increase in 2016.
Products available[edit]
Medigap offerings have been standardized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) into ten different plans, labeled A through N, sold and administered by private companies. Each Medigap plan offers a different combination of benefits. The coverage provided is roughly proportional to the premium paid. However, many older Medigap plans (these 'older' plans are no longer marketed) offering minimal benefits will cost more than current plans offering full benefits. The reason behind this is that older plans have an older average age per person enrolled in the plan, causing more claims within the group and raising the premium for all members within the group. Since Medigap is private insurance and not government sponsored, the rules governing the sale and offerings of a Medigap insurance policy can vary from state to state. Some states such as Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin require Medigap insurance to provide additional coverage than what is defined in the standardized Medigap plans.
Some employers may provide Medigap coverage as a benefit to their retirees. While Medigap offerings have been standardized since 1992, some seniors who had Medigap plans prior to 1992 are still on non-standard plans. Those plans are no longer eligible for new policies. Over the years, new laws have brought many changes to Medigap Policies. For example, marketing for plans E, H, I, and J has been stopped as of May 31, 2010. But, if you were already covered by plan E, H, I, or J before June 1, 2010, you can keep that plan. Medigap plans M and N took effect on June 1, 2010, bringing the number of offered plans down to ten from twelve.
Congress passed the bill H.R. 2 on April 14, 2015, which will eliminate plans that cover the part B deductible for new Medicare beneficiaries starting Jan. 1st, 2020. Those who enroll in to Medicare after Jan. 1st, 2020 will not be able to purchase plans F or C; however, those people who enrolled onto Medicare prior to Jan. 1st, 2020 will still be able to purchase plans F or C. Congress believes eliminating first dollar coverage plans will save Medicare money.[3]
Drug coverage[edit]
Some Medigap policies sold before January 1, 2006 may include prescription drug coverage, but after that date, no new Medigap policies could be sold with drug coverage. This time frame coincides with the introduction of the Medicare Part D benefit.
Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in a Standalone Part D plan may not retain the drug coverage portion of their Medigap policy. People with Medigap policies that include drug coverage who enrolled in Medicare Part D by May 15, 2006 had a guaranteed right to switch to another Medigap policy that has no prescription drug coverage. Beneficiaries choosing to retain a Medigap policy with drug coverage after that date have no such right; in that case, the opportunity to switch to a Medigap policy without drug coverage is solely at the discretion of the private insurance company issuing the replacement policy, but the beneficiary may choose to remove drug coverage from their current Medigap policy and retain all other benefits.
The vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries who hold a Medigap policy with drug coverage and then enroll in a Part D Plan after May 15, 2006 will have to pay a late enrollment penalty. The only exception is for the few beneficiaries holding a Medigap policy with a drug benefit that is considered ""creditable coverage"" (i.e. that it meets four criteria defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services); a Medigap policy with prescription drug coverage bought before mid-1992 may pay out as much as or more than a Medicare Part D plan. Medigap policies sold in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin with prescription coverage may also pay out as much as or more than Part D.
Thus, individuals who qualify for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program generally also do not need, and should not pay for, Medicare Supplement Insurance. Some employers offer health insurance coverage to their retirees. Retirees who are covered by such group plans may not need to purchase an individual policy. While a retiree may choose to switch to an individual plan, this may not be a good choice because group retiree plans usually do not cost anything to the individual and the group coverage is often as good or better than most individual Medigap policies. Thus, the individual should compare his company's policy costs and coverage with the ten Medigap policies. The retiree should also consider the stability of his company. If it is conceivable that the company will falter, that his costs will rise, or that coverage will diminish, the individual may wish to purchase an independent policy. Remember, however, that if a new policy is purchased, the old policy must be dropped. More information at http://cms.gov, http://medicare.gov, http://ssa.gov

Medicare Supplement Insurance, also known as “Medigap” insurance, provides supplemental health insurance coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. Individuals in traditional Medicare may want to obtain Medicare Supplement (“Medigap”) insurance because Medicare often covers less than the total cost of the beneficiary’s health care.
Medicare is divided into two coverage components, Part A and Part B. Both programs have gaps in coverage that may be covered by supplemental insurance.
GAPS IN COVERAGE
Medicare Part A Gaps
Medicare Part A (also known as Hospital Insurance) covers inpatient hospital, inpatient skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospice services. The following is a partial list of gaps in coverage that are not reimbursed by Medicare:
- Hospital deductible per spell of illness;
- Hospital coinsurance payments (Medicare covers the first 60 days in full after the deductible has been met; days 61 to 90 require a copayment, and days 91 to 150 – the “lifetime reserve days” – a higher copayment still);
- Hospital services beyond 150 days per spell of illness;
- Skilled nursing facility coinsurance payments (Medicare covers the first 20 days in full; days 21 to 100 require a daily copayment);
- Skilled nursing facility services beyond 100 days per spell of illness;
- Home health aide services that are provided on more than a part-time or intermittent basis;
- Home health nursing and aide services when there is no longer a skilled care component;
See exact amounts for the current year here. (site visited September 22, 2015).
Medicare Part B Gaps
Medicare Part B (also known as Supplementary Medicare Insurance) provides coverage for a variety of outpatient and physician services. It also pays for durable medical equipment, prosthetic devices, supplies incident to physician’s services, and ambulance transportation. The following is a list of gaps in coverage that are not reimbursed by Medicare:
- Part B deductible (an annual deductible must be met before Medicare will make payment for covered services);
- Part B 20% coinsurance payment (Medicare pays 80% of the approved charge for all Part B services and items, an amount that varies according to the services and items provided);
- Balance billing above the Medicare-approved charge (many physicians and providers charge more than the amount Medicare approves);
NOTE: Starting January 1, 2020, Medigap plans sold to new people with Medicare won’t be allowed to cover the Part B deductible. Because of this, Plans C and F will no longer be available to people new to Medicare starting on January 1, 2020. If you already have either of these 2 plans (or the high deductible version of Plan F) or are covered by one of these plans before January 1, 2020, you’ll be able to keep your plan. If you were eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, but not yet enrolled, you may be able to buy one of these plans.
See exact amounts for the current year here.
WHO NEEDS MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE
Medicare beneficiaries fill in Medicare’s coverage gaps in a number of different ways, including:
- Government Programs (Medicaid/QMB/SLMB);
- Group Retirement Policies (Non-Standardized);
- Non-Standardized Individual Medigap Policies (Issued Prior to July 31, 1992);
- Standardized Individual Medigap Policies (Issued After July 31, 1992).
Medicare beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicaid (Title 19) do not need Medigap insurance since Medicaid will cover the cost of their health care expenses. People who do not qualify for Medicaid but are within 100% of the federal poverty level are eligible for coverage under a program known as the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program (QMB). QMB program benefits include:
- Payment of Medicare premiums.
- Payment of Medicare annual deductibles.
- Payment of Medicare coinsurance amounts.
Thus individuals who qualify for the QMB program generally also do not need, and should not pay for, Medicare Supplement Insurance. The qualifying income figures change in April each year. Contact the Department of Social Services office in your area to find out more about Title 19 and QMB eligibility and enrollment.
Individuals who do not qualify for QMB because of excess income may qualify for the Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary Program (SLMB) or Qualified Individual Program (QI). People who have incomes within 120% – 135% of the federal poverty level are eligible for SLMB or QI coverage. However, SLMB and QI only pay for the Medicare Part B monthly premium. Therefore, SLMB and QI individuals may still want to purchase Medigap insurance if they can afford to do so. Like QMB, the qualifying income figures change in April each year and the programs are administered by the Department of Social Services.
Some employers offer health insurance coverage to their retirees. Retirees who are covered by such group plans may not need to purchase an individual policy. While a retiree may choose to switch to an individual plan, this may not be a good choice because group retiree plans usually do not cost anything to the individual and the group coverage is often as good or better than most individual Medigap policies. Thus the individual should compare his company’s policy costs and coverage with the ten Medigap policies. The retiree should also consider the stability of his company. If it is conceivable that the company will falter, that his costs will rise, or that coverage will diminish, the individual may wish to purchase an independent policy. Remember, however, that if a new policy is purchased the old policy must be dropped.
Most Medicare beneficiaries are not eligible for Medicaid or QMB, however, and may want to obtain Medigap insurance. Approximately two-thirds purchase Medigap policies. As of July 31, 1992, Medigap policies were standardized throughout the United States. This mandatory standardization was a result of legislation passed by Congress through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. There are ten specific benefit plans which federal law permits to be sold as Medigap policies. Two new plans were added in 2006. States may allow all or some of these plans to be marketed. Insurance companies may sell all or some of the plans which the individual state allows them to market. However, there is a basic benefit package, known as the “core benefit” plan, which must be allowed in all states and which must be offered by any company which sells Medigap insurance.
Although individual Medigap policies have been standardized since 1992, some seniors are still covered by previously issued non-standardized plans. These policies are no longer available for purchase. However, individuals may continue to keep their old policies and many people have chosen to do so. Individuals covered by an old policy should consider changing to a new “standardized” plan, and should compare the benefits and costs of each of the policies. Then an informed decision can be made. An individual who purchases a new standardized policy can only have one Medigap policy and must therefore drop the old, non-standardized plan. This protects people from the unnecessary costs of duplicate coverage.
THE STANDARD MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT POLICIES
The twelve standardized benefit policies are labeled A through L. Policy A contains the basic or “core” benefits. The other eleven policies contain the core benefits plus one or more additional benefits. The following is a list of the benefits that are contained in the core policy and that must be contained in all new Medigap policies sold beginning July 31, 1992:
- Part A Hospital Coinsurance for Days 61-90;
- Part A Hospital Lifetime Reserve Coinsurance for Days 91-150;
- 365 Lifetime Hospital Days Beyond Medicare Coverage;
- Parts A and B Three Pint Blood Deductible;
- Part B 20% Coinsurance.
Additional benefits are offered in policies B through L. Each plan offers a different combination of these benefits in addition to the core benefits. Additional benefits are:
- Part A Skilled Nursing Facility Coinsurance for Days 21-100;
- Part A Hospital Deductible;
- Part B Deductible;
- Part B Charges above the Medicare Approved Amount (if provider does not accept assignment);
- Foreign Travel Emergency Coverage;
- At-Home Recovery (Home Health Aid Services);
- Preventive Medical Care.
Policies B through L vary considerably. Beneficiaries should review the policy packages carefully and decide which coverages are appropriate for them. The chart at the end of these materials illustrates the various coverages for Medigap policies A through L.
There are many issues which must be considered before purchasing Medigap insurance. For example, what specific benefits does the individual require? How much will the premiums cost?
Are the benefits worth the cost? Will the individual be able to afford the premiums in the future? What if he/she decides to switch to a Medicare Advantage plan and then wants to, or has to, switch back?
Certain consumer protections are provided pursuant to federal law and protect Medicare beneficiaries across the country. Connecticut provides additional protections. Some of those protections are described below.
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW
Guaranteed Issue
Guaranteed issue means that an insurance company is required to sell a policy and may not force an individual to prove “insurability” by making the person pass an insurance physical examination.
All newly entitled Medicare beneficiaries have a right to guaranteed issue of any Medigap policy which is offered for sale for the first six months after their Medicare entitlement begins. This right only applies to Medicare beneficiaries who are 65 years of age or older. Insurance companies are not required by federal law to offer the same range of Medigap policies to Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities that they offer for sale to Medicare beneficiaries over age 65. Some states require insurance companies to sell designated Medigap policies to Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities. Connecticut requires insurance companies to offer Plans A, B and C to Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities, if they offer these policies for sale to older Medicare beneficiaries. Connecticut also requires that insurance companies which offer plans A-L sell these plans at all times to Medicare beneficiaries who are over age 65.
Since 1997, pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicare beneficiaries who are at least 65 years old are also guaranteed issuance of certain Medigap policies if they apply within 63 days after disenrollment from a Medicare managed care plan. The circumstances under which these rights exist are as follows:
- A Medicare beneficiary who enrolled in a Medicare managed care plan upon first becoming eligible for Medicare who subsequently disenrolled within 12 months is guaranteed issue of any Medigap policy offered for sale in her state.
- If such a beneficiary enrolled in a Medicare managed care plan which withdrew from the geographic area within the first 12 months of the individual’s enrollment and the individual enrolled in another Medicare managed care plan, the time in which the beneficiary may disenroll and purchase any Medigap plan is extended for a second 12 month period, for a total of 24 months.
- A Medicare beneficiary who dropped a Medigap policy upon enrolling for the first time in a Medicare managed care plan but who subsequently disenrolled from the managed care plan within 12 months is guaranteed issuance of the same Medigap policy from the same insurance company if that policy is still being offered for sale. Otherwise, such an individual is entitled to guaranteed issuance of Medigap Plans A, B, C or F.
- If such an individual enrolled for the first time in a Medicare managed care plan which withdrew from the geographic area within the first 12 months of the individual’s enrollment, the time in which these special Medigap rights apply is extended for a second 12 month period, for a total of 24 months.
- A Medicare beneficiary who moved out of the area or whose Medicare managed care plan terminated service to her area, became bankrupt or violated or misrepresented a provision of the plan is guaranteed issuance of Medigap Plans A, B, C or F. These same rights apply to Medicare beneficiaries whose employer stops providing retiree health insurance.
- NOTE: Connecticut beneficiaries over age 65 have the right to purchase Policies A – L from any company selling those policies in Connecticut.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has stated that the above Balanced Budget Act provisions do NOT apply to Medicare beneficiaries whose Medicare entitlement is based on their disability or upon End Stage Renal Disease. According to CMS, these provisions apply only to Medicare beneficiaries who are at least 65 years old.
Upon purchasing a Medigap policy, a Medicare beneficiary has 30 days in which to change her mind, cancel the policy and receive a refund of the previously paid premium.
Pre-Existing Conditions
A pre-existing condition exclusion means that health insurance may not cover the costs incurred as a result of a medical condition a person had prior to obtaining the health insurance coverage. The ability of insurance companies to impose pre-existing condition exclusions has been severely constricted since the enactment of a federal law called “HIPAA.” Under HIPAA, if an individual had health insurance coverage for a period of at least 6 months prior to their initial open enrollment period for Medicare, no pre-existing condition exclusion may be imposed. Most types of health coverage offer this “creditable coverage,” including employee or union group health insurance, retiree health insurance, Medicare Parts A and B and Medicaid (Title 19).
For Medigap purposes, creditable coverage is conferred for the number of months an individual was covered by another Medigap policy or was enrolled in a Medicare HMO. Thus, if an individual was previously in another Medigap plan or Medicare managed care plan for at least six months, no pre-existing condition limit can be imposed by a new Medigap plan.
Prohibition on Duplicate Policies
Another important provision of the law is that insurance companies and agents are prohibited from selling a beneficiary a second Medigap policy. An insurance agent is required to disclose this provision to Medicare beneficiaries and must obtain a written acknowledgment. A new policy may be sold to replace an existing policy, but this fact must also be acknowledged in writing. However, an individual may keep or purchase another medical insurance policy which is not a Medigap policy. Such policies include hospital indemnification coverage which only provide benefits for hospitalization and nothing else. When an insurance company or independent insurance agency sells such a policy, they must disclose to the purchaser the specific coverage and certify that the policy is not a Medigap policy.
Agents must also ask if the beneficiary is eligible for Medicaid coverage. A policy holder who becomes eligible for Medicaid may have premiums suspended for up to two years. If Medicaid eligibility is terminated during this period, the individual will be able to return to his prior Medigap policy.
ADDITIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR POLICIES SOLD IN CONNECTICUT
In Connecticut, any insurance company which sells Medigap plans A through L must sell them to any Medicare beneficiary over the age of 65 at any time, regardless of age, gender, medical condition or previous health insurance claims history. Insurance companies are prohibited from refusing coverage under these plans based upon a person’s medical conditions or medical history. This means that insurance companies are not allowed to medically underwrite plans A through L for any Medicare beneficiary over the age of 65. Thus, no health insurance company may require a health insurance examination of an older Medicare beneficiary prior to authorizing the sale of these Medigap plans.
RECENT CHANGES TO MEDIGAP INSURANCE
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Modernization and Improvement Act (MMA) contains provisions which affected Medigap insurance. This new law, which went into effect on January 1, 2006, changed coverage under Medigap plans H, I, and J and created two additional Medigap plans, designated K and L.
A few minor, recent changes took place starting in 2015. Plans D & G removed its coverage of at-home recovery. Plan G now covers 100 percent of Part B excess charges.
The Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA)[1] required alterations in the Medigap plans sold after June 1, 2010. MIPPA reduced the number of standardized plans from 12 to 10—Plans E, H, I, and J were taken away. After the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA)[2] was enacted, plans H,I, and J offered benefits to other plans—these plans were taken away because they were perceived to be duplicates. Plan E became unnecessary because of other MIPPA changes. Additionally, MIPPA took away the “at-home recovery” and “preventative care” benefits Medigap plans could offer. At the same time, a new hospice benefit that covers all cost-sharing for Part A eligible hospice care and respite care expenses was added.
The new plans, M and N, offer options with lower anticipated premiums and higher beneficiary cost sharing. Plan M covers skilled nursing facility copayments, pays 50 percent of the Medicare deductible, and covers medically necessary emergency care in a foreign country. Plan N covers skilled nursing copayments, medically necessary coverage abroad, as well as 100 percent of the Medicare Part A deductible. Plan N also covers the following: 1.) the lesser of the Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment for each covered emergency room visit or $50 and 2.) the less of the Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment for each covered health care provider office visit or $20. The aforementioned copayment for an emergency room visit is waived if the insured is admitted to any hospital and the emergency visit is subsequently covered as part of a Part A expense. Finally, CMS has determined that certain office visits or evaluative and management visits such as laboratory services, x-rays, as well as visits concerning durable medical equipment are not subject to cost sharing.
Hospice care has been added to Plan K in recent years.
WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN PURCHASING MEDIGAP INSURANCE
There are many considerations when purchasing Medigap insurance. The most important considerations are the person’s medical needs and financial abilities. The individual should look at his or her current needs and abilities and also try to anticipate future concerns.
Obtaining Coverage and Switching Policies
Remember that under federal law an individual age 65 or older may enroll in any of the twelve policies during the six-month period after first being covered by Part B. Connecticut beneficiaries over age 65 are guaranteed the ability to purchase Medigap plans A-L beyond this six-month period.
Remember that prior coverage under another Medigap policy or Medicare Managed care plan counts toward the six-month waiting period for coverage of pre-existing conditions. Finally, some companies have liberal rules about letting a person switch from one policy to another policy offered by that company.
Cost
The next major consideration in selecting a Medigap policy is cost. A person must be able to afford the particular policy he or she desires. There is a great deal of price difference from policy to policy.
There is also a big difference in price from company to company for the same policy. For example, monthly premiums for companies selling Policy C in Connecticut range from $138.50 to $310.00 yet all the policies offer the exact same benefits. Thus, before purchasing one of the higher priced policies, the buyer should be certain that he desires something else about the company besides the policy’s benefits (for example, a reputation for timely claims processing).
MEDIGAP STANDARD MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PLANS – SEE ARTICLE BELOW ON CHANGES TO MEDIGAP POLICIES
* Plan K covers 100% of cost sharing for Medicare Part B preventive services and 100% of all cost sharing under Medicare Parts A and B for the balance of the calendar year once an individual has reached the out-of-pocket limit on annual expenditures of $5,560.00 in 2019.
** Plan L covers 100% of cost sharing for Medicare Part B preventive services and 100% of all cost sharing under Medicare Parts A and B for the balance of the calendar year once an individual has reached the out-of-pocket limit on annual expenditures of $2,780.00 in 2019.
NOTE: If you live in Massachusetts, Minnesota, or Wisconsin, Medigap policies are standardized in a different way.
MEDIGAP DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT FOR HIGH DEDUCTIBLE POLICY OPTIONS The 2019 deductible amount for Medigap high deductible plans F & J is $2,300.00. The high deductible amount for Medigap plans F and J is updated each year and is based on the August CPI-U figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The full text of the announcement is available on the CMS website at: http://www.cms.gov/Medigap/. This figure represents the out-of-pocket expense, excluding premiums that a beneficiary must incur before the policy begins paying any benefits. Under the high deductible option, policies pay 100% of covered out-of-pocket expenses once the deductible has been satisfied in a year. Note, the high deductible option for benefit packages F or J was added by Section 4032 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Sec. 1882(p) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395ss(p).

If you have the Original Medicare Plan, you might find gaps in your coverage that you want to address. Luckily, there are options to help supplement your Medicare: Medigap and Medicare Advantage. However, Medigap and Medicare Advantage can’t be used together. You have to decide which plan works for you. Discover what the difference between the two plans are and which option will best serve you.
What Is Medigap?
Medigap, also known as Medicare Supplement Insurance, is a type of health insurance that offers additional coverage for normal Medicare plans. It helps fill in the “gaps” in normal Medicare coverage by helping you pay for out-of-pocket costs that Medicare won’t cover. Some of these expenses include:
Medigap plans are offered by private insurance companies that are licensed by the state to provide the plan. There are typically different types of Medigap plans, each providing different degrees of coverage. Though the number of plans varies from state to state, the majority of the U.S. can offer 10 different types of Medigap coverage. Many people decide to select Medigap Plan F, which has the broadest coverage out of all the different types of Medigap available.
What Is Medicare Advantage?
Medicare Advantage, sometimes called “Plan C,” offers an alternative to the original Medicare plans. These plans are bundled with the typical Medicare Plan A and B plans, creating more complete coverage for the insured person. If you opt for Medicare Advantage, you are still a Medicare patient. Medicare Advantage plans are typically provided by private insurance companies that are approved by Medicare, but they are funded by the government. In addition to normal Medicare coverage, the Medicare Advantage plan covers expenses for:
While the exact details vary depending on the specific plan, Medicare Advantage plans can also be tailored to cover costs related to chronic illnesses or conditions that you may have. The Medicare Advantage plans may also cover additional expenses, such as:
Most Medicare Advantage Plans will also include Medicare Part D, also known as prescription drug coverage. However, if the plan doesn’t include this, you can always join a separate Medicare prescription drug plan.
Medigap vs. Medicare Advantage - Key Differences
While the Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans can each be beneficial, there are key differences between the two. Being well acquainted with these differences can help you choose the type of plan that works best for you.
Price
The primary difference between the Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans come at a different cost. Generally speaking, Medigap plans have higher premiums than Medicare Advantage plans. However, Medicare Advantage plans often cover less expenses than Medigap — potentially resulting in more out-of-pocket expenses. You can save money by choosing the plan that makes sense for your specific conditions and lifestyle.
Choice of Physicians
One key difference that might influence your decision to select Medigap or Medicare Advantage plan is the choice of physicians they offer. Be mindful of the limitations of both plans if you have a chronic condition that requires you to see specific specialists. Medicare Advantage offers a limited selection of physicians and facilities within their network. Certain Medicare Advantage plans don’t cover out-of-network physicians at all. Some Medigap plans offer more flexibility. Both Medigap and Medicare Advantage will cover any physician or facility that accepts Medicare.
Location
One major determinant of which plan you choose is where you are located and your lifestyle. If you live in one state and rarely travel, then Medicare Advantage might be best suited to you. If you live in more than one state throughout the year or travel frequently, then Medigap may be a better choice. Medicare Advantage plans usually offer coverage in one region exclusively. They also don’t typically offer coverage when traveling internationally. In contrast, many Medigap plans provide coverage in all 50 states and when traveling outside of the U.S.
Benefits of Medigap
Medigap bolsters Medicare plans A and B by filling in the “gaps” in coverage and providing more comprehensive options for the insured person. It covers almost all of the out-of-pocket costs in the Original Medicare plan.
Aside from having more comprehensive coverage in general, one of the top benefits of Medigap is the cost. While the premiums can be higher than Medicare Advantage, these premiums result in few to no out-of-pocket costs.
It also offers a great deal of flexibility in terms of the physician network. Generally, any physician or facility that accepts Medicare is covered by Medigap. This stands in stark contrast to the more limited network offered by Medicare Advantage.
Another great advantage of Medigap is the lack of effort involved in filing a claim. There is virtually no paperwork to deal with. Checks are automatically made to providers and facilities after Medicare pays its portion of the bill.
Benefits of Medicare Advantage
Medicare Advantage is an extension of Medicare plans A and B, offering more coverage than Original Medicare. This option is very popular because it replaces the Original Medicare Plan while still remaining affordable. It often has much lower premiums than Medigap, making it an attractive option if you don’t anticipate using it frequently. For many plans, if you hit the maximum out-of-pocket costs, the plan will cover you for the rest of the year.
Another benefit of the Medicare Advantage plan is that enrollment is simple. You qualify for the Medicare Advantage plan once you qualify for the Original Medicare plan, and enrollment occurs annually.
Most Medicare Advantage plans also include prescription drug coverage, otherwise known as Plan D. In contrast, Medigap does not offer prescription drug coverage. This means that the person being insured must purchase a prescription plan separately.",Medigap,13

Supplemental insurance helps bridge the gap of costs not covered by original Medicare
Josh Dickinson
En español | If you decide to enroll in Original Medicare, one way you can help pay the extra costs the program doesn’t cover is to buy a supplemental — or Medigap — insurance policy. In 2020 the choice of Medigap plans set by the federal government is changing, but only for people who first become eligible to join Medicare beginning in January.
Medigap policies are sold by private insurers, but they are strictly regulated by states and the federal government. These plans are available for people enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, not for those who elect a Medicare Advantage plan. Medigap plans pay for costs such as deductibles and copays and other charges that Medicare doesn’t cover.
In 2010 the federal government standardized the types of Medigap plans, creating 10 options designated by A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M and N. Beginning in January, two of the more comprehensive and popular plans, C and F, will no longer be sold to people newly eligible for the program. That’s because in 2015, Congress decided to prohibit Medigap from covering the annual deductible for Part B, which pays for doctor visits and other outpatient services.
Of the 10 Medigap plans, C and F currently pay that deductible, which was $185 for 2019 (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not yet announced the deducible for 2020). The difference between plans C and F is that C does not cover the 15 percent in excess charges that doctors who don’t participate in Medicare are allowed to charge their patients; Plan F does.
Plan G is the closest in design to Plan F. It covers everything F does except the Part B deductible. And Plan D is the closest to Plan C. It covers everything C does except the Part B deductible and the excess charges that nonparticipating doctors are allowed to charge their Medicare patients.
It’s been widely reported that Plan F is “going away,” says Casey Schwarz, senior counsel for education and federal policy at the Medicare Rights Center. “That shorthand has caused a lot of panic,” she says. “I think it’s really important to highlight that for people who have been enrolled in Plan C and Plan F, there is absolutely nothing changing.”
But individuals who don’t turn 65 until after Jan. 1 or who become disabled after the first of the year who want to buy a Medigap plan will not be able to enroll in either C or F. Current Medicare enrollees and anyone eligible for Medicare before Jan. 1, 2020, will still have those plans to choose from.
If you think a Medigap policy might be right for you, here is some basic information you’ll need to know to make your decision.
The catch
And it’s a big one. When you first enroll in Medicare (that is, during the seven-month initial enrollment period, or IEP), insurers offering Medigap policies cannot deny you coverage or charge you more for any preexisting condition. After that, anything goes. For example, if you don’t buy a Medigap policy during your IEP but decide a year later that you want one, insurers may be able to turn you down based on your health status, or set prices higher due to a preexisting condition. How that works differs widely from state to state. “What’s really important is that people find out what their rights are in their state,” Schwarz emphasizes.
The message: To be guaranteed stable, ongoing Medigap coverage for years to come, the time to buy is when you first enroll in Medicare.
The choices
To compare your Medigap plan choices, go to medicare.gov and, under the Supplements & Other Insurance tab, click on How to Compare Medigap Policies. Details are there on a single chart.
Don’t get confused by the way these policies are named. The letter designations of the Medigap policies have nothing to do with which Medicare program you chose.
Because the Medigap plans are standardized, an A or F plan sold by one insurer covers the same things as an A or F plan sold by another insurer. Medigap plans are consistent in all but three states: Massachusetts, Minnesota and Wisconsin have their own standard policies.
So how do the 10 policies differ? “Some are high deductible, some require higher cost-sharing, and some cover more costs,” explains Mary Mealer, life and health manager at the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions & Professional Registration. Consumers should “evaluate their individual situation as to what plan meets their needs and what they can afford,” she advises.
What to focus on
The government’s comparison chart shows 10 health care costs that could be covered by a Medigap policy. Some come into play more than others, so you should focus most on those big-ticket items. They include:
- Your 20 percent share of the cost of doctor visits
- Your 20 percent share of the cost of lab tests and other outpatient services
- The deductible for each time you are admitted to a hospital
- The coinsurance costs of hospital stays or stays in a skilled nursing facility after being in a hospital
There are other considerations, as well. For instance, while other plans cover 100 percent of Part B coinsurance, plans K and L have higher cost-sharing but also an out-of-pocket limit. Once you’ve paid that amount, they take care of 100 percent of covered services for the rest of the year. In 2019 the limit for the K plan is $5,560, and the limit for the L is $2,780. These limits increase each year, based on inflation.
Remember, Medigap does not cover prescription drugs or dental, vision or most other needs that Original Medicare doesn’t cover.
What it will cost you
Nationwide, the average premium for the most popular Medigap F plan costs roughly $326 a month. There is also a high-deductible F plan ($2,300 for 2019 ), and that premium averages about $68 a month. Premiums are based on three pricing systems and vary widely based on where you live.
- Community rated: The same monthly premium is charged to everyone who has this policy, regardless of age.
- Issue-age rated: This premium is based on your age when you first buy the policy. The younger you are, the lower the initial premium. Any premium increases in the future will not be based on your age.
- Attained-age rated: This premium is initially based on your current age but can rise as you get older.
Experts suggest that you ask a potential insurer which pricing system it uses before buying a Medigap policy. That way you’ll know whether to expect increases as you age.
Additional considerations
Mealer suggests that consumers contact their state’s insurance department before signing to make sure the agent and company selling the policy are licensed by the state and to find out that company’s complaint record. Each state has a State Health Insurance Assistance Program that can help you find this information.
And remember, changing a Medigap policy can be hard. Give the policy one last read to see if it covers not just your current needs but potential future needs.

See if Medigap supplemental insurance makes sense for you.
Key takeaways
- Medicare does not cover all health care expenses in retirement.
- Medigap can help eliminate many Medicare out-of-pocket costs, extend skilled nursing home and hospital coverage, and cover health care costs when traveling abroad.
- You can generally keep your doctors under Medigap.
Jeff and Alison Otto of Framingham, Massachusetts, knew picking a Medicare plan would take time and effort. So they talked to friends, family, and their doctor, and read extensively about their options. What really surprised them was the realization that Medicare would not cover all their health care costs in retirement, including those when traveling abroad.
""We travel a lot and want the security of knowing we can get medical treatment away from home,"" says Jeff, who with Alison is looking forward to visiting her family in England. So the Ottos decided to buy Medigap insurance to cover health care costs that Medicare does not.
Medicare and Medigap
Since its introduction in 1965, Medicare was designed to cover only a portion of a retiree's health care needs. ""Original Medicare"" includes 2 parts: Part A, hospitalization coverage, and Part B, physicians and outpatient services. Only selected services are covered, and costs are shared between Medicare and you.
When it's time for you to sign up for Medicare, you have 3 primary options: You can choose to pay what Medicare doesn't cover from your own pocket, buy supplemental insurance, such as Medigap, or buy an all-in-one policy called a Medicare Advantage Plan.
Medigap plans are sold by private insurance companies and are identified by capital letters—A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N.1 Each lettered plan, regardless of the insurance company, must offer the same standardized features. Beneficiaries eligible for Medicare starting January 1, 2020, won't be offered Plan F and Plan C. Beneficiaries who are already in Plan F and Plan C can continue their coverage as it is.
Why buy Medigap?
Here are 4 common reasons retirees choose to add Medigap to traditional Medicare.
- Medigap can eliminate most of your Parts A and B out-of-pocket costs. Generally, under Medicare, you are responsible for a portion of the cost after deductibles. Your Medigap insurance may pay for your portion of coinsurance, copays, and other costs you owe.
- Medigap provides some long-term care coverage. With Medicare, you get a limited number of coverage days for hospital stays, time in a skilled nursing facility (for example, after surgery or for rehabilitation services after a fall), or if hospice care is needed. Medigap provides additional time in these facilities, just in case.
- Medigap covers health care needs when traveling abroad.2 If you don't plan to travel frequently, it might be more cost effective to look into travel insurance, including medical evacuation insurance for emergencies overseas. Pricing will depend on where you are going, your age, and how long you will be traveling.
- Medigap generally lets you keep your doctors. Still, it's important to check with your doctors, specialists, hospitals, and medical facilities to make sure they accept the exact insurance company and Medigap policy you are considering.
When should you enroll in Medigap?
You can enroll in a Medigap plan after you've enrolled in Medicare Part B. Generally, there are 2 time periods when you'll be eligible without any medical underwriting or worry about pre-existing conditions.
- You've turned 65 and enrolled in Part B. In this ""initial enrollment period,"" you have 6 months to select and enroll in a Medigap policy.
- You are older than 65 and losing employer coverage. Once you enroll in Medicare Part B, you'll have 6 months to buy a Medigap policy.
If you miss your initial 6-month enrollment window, insurance companies generally require medical underwriting and you can be denied coverage, or may have to pay a higher premium for a Medigap policy, sometimes substantially higher.
As time passes, you can switch plans based on cost or a different level of coverage, but do so cautiously. Do not stop paying premiums on your existing plan before you find a new plan that will accept you. Switching by choice usually means you'll be subject to medical underwriting. Higher costs or outright denial may be the outcome.
How much Medigap coverage?
When deciding how much gap coverage you'll need, it's important to think about your health situation at age 65 and how healthy you might be at 75, 85, and 95. Steve Feinschreiber, senior vice president at Fidelity Financial Solutions, offers 4 rules of thumb to consider as you shop for Medigap insurance:
- Don't overestimate the status or durability of your good health. ""Consider the practical reality of needing more insurance as you age,"" advises Feinschreiber. ""Even elite athletes run into health problems as they move through the decades.""
- Use your family health history as a guide. ""Talk to your doctor about aging and take a look at your family history,"" says Feinschreiber. ""It could be a good guide to help decide the kind of coverage you might want to plan for.""
- Choose your insurance separately from your spouse. Since there is no ""joint"" or ""family"" coverage under Medicare, it may be most cost effective for you and your spouse to choose different coverage options from separate insurance companies.
- Weigh costs vs. coverage. Medigap plans can be quite costly. ""If you find the costs for gap insurance are hurting the overall health of your retirement income plan, think about where you might be able to make trade-offs,"" says Feinschreiber. ""It's about finding the right balance so you have sufficient coverage and don't run out of money over the course of your retirement.""
Countdown to Medicare
Because choosing a Medigap plan can be rather time consuming and complicated, it's a good idea to get started early, perhaps by age 64, or at least 6 months before you retire. To simplify the process, use our checklist.
Checklist: Medicare and Medigap steps to take before you turn 65
(or at least 6 months before losing your employer health insurance)
Age 64
- Download your ""Medicare and You"" book from the Medicare website.
- Talk to your employer about coverage options if retiring or if continuing to work.
- Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss Medicare and Medigap options.
- Use Medicare Plan finder to search and compare various Medigap options in your area.
- Schedule any medical appointments needed, including vision and dental (to maximize your existing coverage).
1–3 months before turning age 65
- Apply online for Medicare Parts A & B.
- Make final decision for a Medigap policy.
- Finalize any details with your employer.
- Look for your Medicare cards to arrive in the mail.
65th birthday month
- Confirm that your coverage is in place for the first day of your birthday month.
- Apply for your Medigap Supplement Insurance.
Hopefully for you, like the Ottos, the transition into Medicare and Medigap will be quite seamless. The Ottos realize that their needs may change over time, especially as they curtail travel plans as they get older. ""Although we've seen costs increase over the last 2 years since we enrolled in Medigap, we have the right level of supplemental coverage for now and think we're getting good value at $800 per month for the both of us including dental coverage,"" said Alison.

Note that the limiting charge applies only to certain services and does not apply to some supplies and durable medical equipment; VT: Vermont law generally prohibits a physician from charging more than the Medicare approved amount. However, there are exceptions and this prohibition may not apply if you receive services out of state.
†Care needed immediately because of an injury or an illness of sudden and unexpected onset.

Do you have fairly frequent doctor or hospital visits? If so, you may already know that Medicare Part A and Part B come with out-of-pocket costs you have to pay. You might be able to save money with a Medicare Supplement insurance plan. Medicare Supplement, or Medigap, insurance plans fill in “gaps” in basic benefits left behind by Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.
In 47 states, there are up to 10 standardized Medicare Supplement insurance plans that are denoted by the letters A through N (plans E, H, I, and J are no longer sold). The private insurance companies offering these plans do not have to offer every Medicare Supplement plan, but they must offer at least Plan A.
Please note that although the names may sound similar, the “parts” of Medicare, such as Part A and Part B, are not the same as Medigap Plan A, Plan B, etc.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan basic benefits
Each Medicare Supplement insurance plan offers a different level of basic benefits, but each lettered plan must include the same standardized basic benefits regardless of insurance company and location. For example, Medicare Supplement Plan G in Florida includes the same basic benefits as Plan G in North Dakota. Please note that if you live in Massachusetts, Minnesota, or Wisconsin, your Medicare Supplement insurance plan options are different than in the rest of the country. Medicare Supplement insurance plans do not have to cover vision, dental, long-term care, or hearing aids, but all plans must cover at least a portion of the following basic benefits:
- Medicare Part A coinsurance costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are exhausted
- Medicare Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayments
- Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayments
- First three pints of blood used in a medical procedure
Some plans include additional basic benefits. For example, Medicare Supplement Plan F*, the most comprehensive standardized Medigap insurance plan, carries the following additional benefits:
- Medicare Part A deductible
- Medicare Part B deductible*
- Part B excess charges
- Part B preventive care coinsurance
- Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) care coinsurance
- Foreign travel emergency care (80% of Medicare-approved costs, up to plan limits)
Some plans may include additional innovative benefits.
*Medicare Supplement plans that may cover the Medicare Part B deductible – Medicare Supplement Plans C and F – will be phased out. If you’re not eligible for Medicare until January 1, 2020 or later, you won’t be able to buy Plan C or Plan F. You won’t generally have to give up your Plan C or Plan F if you already have one. If you’re eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, you might be able to buy Plan C or Plan F.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan costs
Although private insurance companies are required to offer the same basic benefits for each lettered plan, they do have the ability to charge different premiums. You might want to shop around to find a Medicare Supplement insurance plan that may fit your medical and financial needs. Insurance companies may price their plan premiums in any of the following ways:
- Community no-age-rated: These Medicare Supplement insurance plans charge premiums that are the same across the board, regardless of age.
- Issue-age-rated: These plans base their premiums on your age when you first enrolled in the policy. Therefore, the younger you are when you enroll in this type of plan, the lower your premium will be.
- Attained-age-rated: Like issue-age-rated, these plans base their premiums on the age you were when you first bought a policy, but unlike issue-age-rated, premiums increase as you get older.
Please note that no matter what rating method an insurance company uses, premiums may increase over time for reasons other than age, such as inflation.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan enrollment and eligibility
To be eligible to enroll in a Medicare Supplement insurance plan, you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B. A good time to enroll in a plan is generally during the Medigap Open Enrollment Period, which begins on the first day of the month that you are both age 65 or older and enrolled in Part B, and lasts for six months. During this period, you have a guaranteed-issue right to join any Medicare Supplement insurance plan available where you live. You may not be denied basic benefits based on any pre-existing conditions** during this enrollment period (although a waiting period may apply). If you miss this enrollment period and attempt to enroll in the future, you may be denied basic benefits or charged a higher premium based on your medical history. In some states, you may be able to enroll in a Medigap plan before the age of 65.
**Pre-existing conditions are generally health conditions that existed before the start of a policy. They may limit coverage, be excluded from coverage, or even prevent you from being approved for a policy; however, the exact definition and relevant limitations or exclusions of coverage will vary with each plan, so check a specific plan’s official plan documents to understand how that plan handles pre-existing conditions

Medicare Supplement (also known as Medigap or MedSupp) insurance plans help cover certain out-of-pocket costs that Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, doesn’t cover. There are 10 plan types available in most states, and each plan is labeled with a different letter that corresponds with a certain level of basic benefits.
In most states, Medigap insurance plans have the same standardized benefits for each letter category. This means that the basic benefits for a Plan A, for example, is the same across every insurance company that sells Plan A, regardless of location. This makes it easy to compare Medicare Supplement insurance plans because the main difference between plans of the same letter category will be the premium cost.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin standardize their Medicare Supplement insurance plans differently from the rest of the country. In all states, insurance companies that sell Medicare Supplement insurance aren’t required to offer all plan types. However, any insurance company that sells Medigap insurance is required by law to offer Medigap Plan A. If an insurance company wants to offer other Medigap plans, it must sell either Plan C or Plan F in addition to any other plans it would like to sell.
The chart below allows you to compare Medicare Supplement insurance plans based on what’s offered across the standardized plans that are available in most states.
* There is also a high-deductible version of Plan F where beneficiaries pay a deductible of $2,300 in 2019 before the Medigap plan begins to cover Medicare-covered costs.
An important note about Medicare Supplement Plans F and C: You may not be able to buy these plans if you qualify for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. That includes high-deductible Plan F. If you already have one of these plans, you won’t have to give it up.
You might be able to get a high-deductible Medicare Supplement Plan G in 2020, according to America’s Health Insurance Plans (ahip.org). It doesn’t pay for the Medicare Part B deductible.
** After the out-of-pocket limit (including the Medicare Part B deductible) is reached for Plans K or L, the Medigap plan pays 100% of Medicare-covered services for the remainder of the calendar year.
***Plan N pays 100% of the Medicare Part B coinsurance costs, with the exception of a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to $50 for emergency room visits that don’t result in the beneficiary being admitted as an inpatient.
****Medically Necessary Emergency Care in a Foreign Country: coverage to the extent not covered by Medicare for 80 percent of the billed charges for Medicare-eligible expenses for medically necessary emergency hospital, physician and medical care received in a foreign country, which care would have been covered by Medicare if provided in the United States and which care began during the first 60 consecutive days of each trip outside the United States, subject to a calendar year deductible of $250, and a lifetime maximum benefit of $50,000. For purposes of this benefit, “emergency care” shall mean care needed immediately because of an injury or an illness of sudden and unexpected onset.

- What to Consider in Making Your Choice

- The CARES Act of 2020
Anyone who's ready to sign up for Medicare has a lot of decisions to make. But one decision is especially important: Should you choose Medicare Advantage or use Medigap to supplement your Original Medicare plan?
Key Takeaways
- Traditional Medicare provides good basic health coverage, but it pays only about 80% of approved costs for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures and usually doesn't cover prescription drug costs or such things as routine dental care.
- Medigap supplemental insurance plans are designed to fill Medicare Part A and Part B coverage gaps.
- To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance) within the seven-month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
- You can choose to get your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits through a Medicare Advantage plan. They often include benefits beyond Part A and Part B. Private, Medicare-approved health insurance companies offer these plans.
- Although Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is optional, if you don’t get it as either as a stand-alone plan or as part of a Medicare Advantage plan, there may be financial penalties if you need to buy a policy later on because you need expensive drugs.
- Consider plan costs, plan doctors, convenience, your lifestyle and travel plans, your health, and any additional benefits in making your Medicare coverage choices.
Medicare Coverage
Budgeting for healthcare costs in retirement is tough since there’s usually no way of knowing whether your expenses each year will be minimal or huge. While traditional Medicare (Part A and Part B) provides good basic coverage, it pays only about 80% of the costs it approves for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. The other 20% of the bill is the individual’s responsibility and—unlike coverage under the Affordable Care Act—there is no cap on the amount a person might have to pay in one year.
Let's say, for example, that you need heart bypass surgery. The cost would be a minimum of $85,891, according to the American Heart Association , and you would be responsible for a co-pay of $17,178—or much more if there are complications or something else goes wrong. In addition, some health needs, such as prescription drugs, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and dental care, are not covered at all by regular Medicare (Part A and Part B).
There are two basic ways for recipients to fill most of these coverage gaps and reduce the risk of tremendous bills in a bad health year:
Medicare Plus Medigap Supplemental Insurance Policies
About two-thirds of the 61 million seniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries choose traditional Medicare, Parts A and B, which cover hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. About 80% of these beneficiaries supplement their insurance with Medigap (Medicare Supplement) insurance, Medicaid, employer-sponsored insurance, and/or stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies.
Medicare Supplement insurance plans are not connected with or endorsed by the U.S. government or the federal Medicare program.
While this may be the more expensive option, it has a few advantages. Both Medicare and Medigap insurance plans cover you for any hospital or doctor in the U.S. that accepts Medicare, and the great majority do. There is no need for prior authorization or a referral from a primary care doctor. Coverage includes the entire U.S., which may be important for those who travel frequently or spend part of the year in a different locale. This option is also attractive to those who have particular physicians and hospitals they want to use.
Medicare Advantage Plans
Available from private, Medicare-approved insurance companies, Medicare Advantage policies (Part C) are marketed to consumers under such names as Aetna, Humana, and Kaiser Foundation Medicare plans. They may have no premium or a lower one compared to the significant premiums for Medigap and prescription drug insurance policies. Medicare Advantage plans cover hospitals and doctors and often also include prescription drug coverage and some services not covered by Medicare. A little more than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries choose one of these plans.
Most Medicare Advantage plans operate as health maintenance organization (HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO) insurance. HMOs limit members to using the doctors and hospitals in their networks. PPOs generally let members get care outside the plan's network, but members may have to pay more for such care. Some plans require prior authorization for specialist care or procedures, and/or a referral from a primary care doctor. Plans might not cover care given outside of the network’s geographical area. Extra benefits not covered by regular Medicare, such as eyeglasses, routine dental care, or gym memberships, may be offered.
When to Sign Up for Medicare
As you approach age 65, it’s important to know which enrollment deadlines apply to your circumstances to avoid costly fines and gaps in coverage. Begin by checking on your eligibility. To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospitals) and Part B (doctors) in the seven month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
If you currently get Social Security, you will be automatically enrolled; if not, you need to sign up either online or at your Social Security office.
Medicare Part B
If you are working at age 65, however, and you have employer insurance through a company with more than 20 employees, you have the right to stay on your employer insurance and delay signing up for Medicare Part B until your employer coverage ends. If you work for an employer with fewer than 20 employees, it is very important to ask the employer whether you are required to sign up for Medicare and get that decision in writing.
Medicare Part D
You need to be signed up for Medicare Parts A and B before you can enroll in a Medicare Advantage (Part C) plan. Once you’ve enrolled in Medicare, a key decision point is choosing coverage for Part D prescription drug insurance. If you don’t enroll in Part D insurance when you start Medicare and want to buy drug coverage later on, you may be permanently penalized for signing up late.
You can avoid the penalty, however, if you have what's known as creditable prescription drug coverage, which is prescription drug coverage (from an employer or union, for example) that’s expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. If you have this kind of drug coverage when you become eligible for Medicare, you are generally allowed to keep it. You generally won't have to pay a penalty if you later decide to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and you haven't gone for longer than 63 continuous days without creditable coverage.
Many Medicare Advantage plans include Part D drug insurance, but a stand-alone policy can also be purchased for those who choose regular Medicare (Part A and Part B) or a Medicare Advantage plan that doesn’t include Part D.
Choosing Traditional Medicare Plus a Medigap Plan
Regular or traditional Medicare comprises Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance). You can supplement this coverage with a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and a Medigap supplemental insurance plan. While signing up for Medicare gets you into Parts A and B, you have to take action on your own to buy these supplemental policies.
Finding Part D, Drug Insurance
To get started, find the plans available in your zip code. Once you have created an account at Medicare.gov, you can enter the names of your drugs and use a convenient tool that allows you to compare plan premiums, deductibles, and Medicare star ratings.
If you don’t take many (or any) prescription drugs, look for a plan with a low monthly premium. All plans must still cover most drugs used by people with Medicare. If, on the other hand, you have high prescription drug costs, check into plans that cover your drugs in the donut hole, the coverage gap period that kicks in after you and the plan have spent $4,020 on covered drugs in 2020.
Selecting a Medigap (supplemental) Plan: Recent Changes Limit Choices
Medigap policies are private plans, available from insurance companies or through brokers, but not on medicare.gov. They are labeled Plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, each with a different standardized coverage set. Some plans include emergency medical benefits during foreign travel. Since coverage is standard, there are no ratings of Medigap policies. Consumers can confidently compare insurer’s prices for each letter plan and simply choose the better deal.
As of Jan. 1, 2020, Medigap plans sold to new Medicare beneficiaries aren't allowed to cover the Part B deductible.
Until recently, most people (66%) who bought Medigap policies chose Plan F, which gave the most comprehensive coverage, including paying for the Medicare Part B deductible ($198 in 2020).12 However, in an effort to trim Medicare expenses, Congress suspended Plans C and F for people who become Medicare-eligible in 2020 and beyond.
Plan D and Plan G have similar benefits to Plan C and Plan F, except for not covering the Part B deductible. People who signed up or became eligible for Medicare before 2020 can purchase or continue Plans C or F, though prices may rise and it may be a better deal to switch to a plan that doesn’t cover the deductible.
Choosing a Medicare Advantage Plan
Medicare Advantage Health Plans are similar to private health insurance. Most services, such as office visits, lab work, surgery, and many others, are covered after a small co-pay. Plans might offer an HMO or PPO network and all plans place a yearly limit on total out-of-pocket expenses. Each plan has different benefits and rules. Most provide prescription drug coverage. Some require a referral to see a specialist while others won’t. Some may pay a portion of out-of-network care, while others will cover only doctors and facilities that are in the HMO or PPO network. There are also other types of Medicare Advantage plans.
Selecting a plan with a low or no annual premium can be important. But its also essential to check on co-pay and coinsurance costs, especially for expensive hospital stays and procedures, to estimate your possible annual expenses. Since care is often limited to in-network physicians and hospitals, the quality and size of a particular plan’s network should be an important factor in your choice.
Head to the Find a Medicare plan page at medicare.gov where the compare feature allows you to look at plans side by side. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), an insurance rating organization, also compares what consumers think of Medicare Advantage plan’s services and physicians, and whether the plans meet certain quality standards. Top ratings in 2019 were garnered by an impressive 43 Aetna Medicare Advantage plans sold in 37 states plus the District of Columbia. Other companies with highly-rated Medicare Advantage plans included: Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Humana, Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, and United Healthcare. Be sure to check the ratings for plans available in your state.
What to Consider in Making Your Choice
Your lifestyle, health condition, and finances may all influence whether traditional Medicare plus Medigap or Medicare Advantage is best for you. Here are some things to consider:
The Costs
Medicare Advantage plans might save you money, but be sure to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll need to buy a separate Part D plan if you want that coverage. Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and whether there are any limits in their coverage. If extra benefits are included, such as help with hearing aids and dental bills, be sure to find out how much of these expenses will actually be covered.
Compare these costs to those of purchasing Medigap and stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies. Calculate the premiums, as well as the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance) the policies may require. Yes, these can be complex calculations, but an insurance broker can help by doing the math for you and making cost-saving recommendations.
Choice of Doctors
Traditional Medicare allows you to use any U.S. doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare, and most do. Most Medicare Advantage plans restrict you to using physicians in their network and may cover less, or none, of the expenses of using out-of-network and out-of-town providers.
A plus of Medicare Advantage managed care plans is that care is coordinated and your primary care doctor will be in the loop about the findings of specialists. With traditional Medicare you don’t need a referral to see a specialist or a prior authorization for procedures, but you’ll need to make sure care is coordinated and your doctors are in communication with one another. Often this is best done by developing a relationship with a primary care physician and letting them refer you to specialists.
Local Conditions and Convenience
In some areas where physicians and hospitals are scarce, it’s important to check out both the networks of available Medicare Advantage plans and the locations of providers who accept regular Medicare. Are the doctors accepting new patients? Will you have to travel far to see a provider or be treated at an emergency room? Advice from local professionals, neighbors, and licensed insurance brokers can help you find Medicare Advantage plans that do business in your area. Compare plans to find one that may suit your needs.
Lifestyle Factors
Frequent travel, dual residences, and currently having physicians whom you would like to keep are some of the factors that may make regular Medicare a good choice. Ask your current physicians if they participate in any Medicare Advantage plans and/or accept regular Medicare. For frequent fliers, choosing regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance policy that covers emergency care in foreign countries may be a good bet. Similarly, people who spend part of the year in a different geographical area may find it difficult to stay in network for medical care and might be better off with regular Medicare and a Medigap insurance policy.
Your Health
People with chronic diseases and those who develop a serious health condition should look deeper into the choices available. A Medicare Advantage plan may be a better choice if it has an out-of-pocket maximum that protects you from huge bills. Regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance plan generally allows you more choice in where you receive your care. Check whether any expensive drugs or equipment (such as supplies for people with diabetes) will be covered by your Medicare prescription drug plan, whether it's a stand-alone one or part of a Medicare Advantage plan.
Broader Benefits
Medicare Advantage plans are in the throes of change as the government allows insurers to add coverage for items that are not included in regular Medicare. These include such things as supplying food for service animals; paying for ramps for wheelchairs, hold bars, and indoor air quality monitors; adult day care; and residential and in-home respite care. Many of these benefits are just being initiated, so it pays to reconsider your choice of regular Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage each year during open enrollment to make sure you’re getting the benefits you need most, whether it's home care or transportation to doctors.
Can You Switch? Yes, But There’s a Catch
It’s logical to consider enjoying the cost savings of a Medicare Advantage plan while you’re relatively healthy, and then switching back to regular Medicare if you develop a condition you want treated at an out-of-town facility. In fact, switching between the two forms of Medicare (or between Medicare Advantage plans) is an option for everyone during the open enrollment period in the fall. This Annual Election Period runs from October 15 - December 7 each year.
Here’s the catch. If you switch back to regular Medicare (Part A and Part B), you may not be able to sign up for a Medigap insurance policy. When you first sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B, Medigap insurance companies are generally obligated to sell you a policy, regardless of your medical condition. But in subsequent years they may have the right to charge you extra due to your age and preexisting conditions, or not to sell you a policy at all if you have serious medical problems. Some states have enacted laws to address this. In New York and Connecticut, for example, Medigap insurance plans are guaranteed-issue year-round, while California, Massachusetts, Maine, Missouri, and Oregon have all set aside annual periods in which switching is allowed. If you live in a state that doesn't have this protection, planning to switch between the systems depending on your health condition is a risky business.
The CARES Act of 2020
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package, called the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act, into law. It expands Medicare's ability to cover treatment and services for those affected by COVID-19. The CARES Act also:
- Increases flexibility for Medicare to cover telehealth services.
- Authorizes Medicare certification for home health services by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse specialists.
- Increases Medicare payments for COVID-19-related hospital stays and durable medical equipment.
For Medicaid, the CARES Act clarifies that non-expansion states can use the Medicaid program to cover COVID-19-related services for uninsured adults who would have qualified for Medicaid if the state had chosen to expand. Other populations with limited Medicaid coverage are also eligible for coverage under this state option.",Medicare Supplement Insurance,7

When can I get a Medicare Supplement plan?
Your Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period (OEP) begins the first day of the month in which you are at least 65 and covered under Medicare Part B. You have six months to buy a Medicare Supplement insurance plan when the company is required to sell it to you. If you wait until after your OEP, you can apply anytime you want, but a plan could reject you or charge you more if you have health problems.
There may be other times after your OEP when you have “guaranteed-issue rights” to a Medicare Supplement plan.
For example, say you sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan. (Medicare Supplement plans don’t work with Medicare Advantage plans.)
- Suppose you decide to drop the Medicare Advantage plan and return to Original Medicare.
- Suppose it has been a year or less since you signed up for the Medicare Advantage plan.
- You have a right to buy a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan.
- Your “guaranteed issue rights” to a Medigap plan only apply to certain plans.
Medicare Supplement coverage of pre-existing conditions
Medicare Part A and Part B typically cover pre-existing conditions. The same goes for Medicare Supplement insurance. The difference is, a company may be able to refuse to sell you a Medicare Supplement plan in the first place in some cases.
As long as you buy a Medicare Supplement plan during the six-month Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period, the insurance company cannot refuse to sell you a plan. The insurance company also can’t charge you more because you have health problems or make you wait for basic benefits to begin.
However, you may have to wait up to six months for the Medicare Supplement policy’s benefits to include your pre-existing condition*.
If you apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan outside of your Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period, the private insurance company may “underwrite” the plan.
Underwriting the plan means that you may be subject to a physical exam, and the insurance company can refuse to sell you the plan or they can adjust your premium based on your health status.

How insurance companies set Medigap premiums
There are three ways that an insurance company can set Medigap premium rates for Medicare Supplement plans:
- “Community-rated” (or “no-age-rated”) premiums are the same for everyone, regardless of age.
- “Issue-age-rated” (or “entry-age-rated”) premiums are based on your age when you first buy the policy. The sooner you buy, the less you will pay.
- “Attained-age-rated” premiums are based on your current age, meaning it goes up as you grow older.
Other factors impacting the premium rates of Medicare Supplement plans can include inflation, geography, medical underwriting (if you did not buy a plan when first eligible), and other discounts.
You should check with each specific health insurer to see how it sets Medigap prices before you buy.
*Pre-existing conditions are generally health conditions that existed before the start of a policy. They may limit coverage, be excluded from coverage, or even prevent you from being approved for a policy; however, the exact definition and relevant limitations or exclusions of coverage will vary with each plan, so check a specific plan’s official plan documents to understand how that plan handles pre-existing conditions.

Medicare is an extremely valuable healthcare resource for many seniors. However, Medicare alone does not cover all of the healthcare costs one is likely to face later in life. And since unexpected medical expenses can lead to stress and financial strain, many seniors prefer to be prepared for what might lay ahead.
Medicare Supplement Insurance is one way seniors can plan ahead for these unexpected costs. Customers pay a monthly premium for insurance that lowers or totally covers the out of pocket costs for expenses such as deductibles, copays, hospital stays, and doctor’s appointments. Some plans offer more extensive benefits for expenses such as international healthcare and skilled nursing facilities. There are numerous different plans available to accommodate people who desire different levels of coverage. And while having so many options makes it easy to get the right level of coverage, it can be overwhelming to sort through all of the companies that offer Medicare Supplement plans to find the right one for you.
To help make this decision easier, we’ve created a guide that profiles the best Medicare Supplement companies across the United States. You’ll find details about available plans, pricing models, customer service practices, and additional benefits. As you shop, this guide will help you understand which policies are best for you and help you narrow down your options. If you aren’t sure that Medicare Supplement Insurance is something you need, see our buyer’s guide at the bottom of the page for more insight.
Since it’s a type of insurance, descriptions of Medicare Supplement policies often contain terminology and stipulations that can be confusing to many shoppers. We’ve included this section to help you understand exactly what each plan and company is offering.
Eligibility: Medicare Supplement Insurance can only be purchased by people who are covered by Original Medicare: Parts A and B. Seniors with Part C, or Medicare Advantage, can not purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Insurance is Private: While Medicare is a federal program, it’s important to realize that Medicare Supplement policies are provided to consumers by private insurance companies and not the government. However, both the federal and state governments regulate the plans that are offered. Each insurance company has the ability to decide which plans it wants to offer.
Standardized Plans: All of the plans available are standardized and will offer the same basic benefits, but some companies may offer extra benefits in addition to what is required. Currently, the available plans include A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N. So while factors like the cost of a plan may vary, Plan A from one company must cover the exact same things as Plan A from any other company. Only Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have standardized plans differing from the rest of the country.
Due to new regulations, Plans C and F will not be offered to new Medicare enrollees after January 2020. However, anyone who already has Plans C or F will be able to keep their coverage, and anyone who was eligible for Medicare before January 2020 may still be able to choose Plan C or F.
Medigap: As you shop for Medicare Supplement plans, you’ll likely see companies use the term “Medigap.” Medigap is simply another popular term for Medicare Supplement Insurance. Some websites may also use the abbreviation MSI.
Plan Types: Some plans are available in high-deductible, select, and innovative options. The government does not require companies to offer these options.
Prescription Medications: Medicare Supplement plans do not cover prescription medication. However, customers who want this coverage can add on Medicare Part D, which is offered by many companies who provide Medicare Supplement plans.
Pricing Structures: When shopping for Medicare Supplement Insurance, you’ll likely encounter three different pricing structures that affect how much your policy costs. The pricing structure that is used will be determined by the company issuing the policy as well as state laws. These pricing structures are:
The world of insurance is large and there are hundreds of companies across the country offering Medicare Supplement plans. So to narrow it down and choose the best companies in the industry, we took the following factors into consideration:
Variety of Plans Offered
While there are countless companies offering Medicare Supplement Insurance, many only offer a couple of policies out of the 10 available. We focused our search on companies that are able to provide a majority of the available plans. These companies give potential customers the greatest amount of options to select a plan that fits their needs.
Number of States Served
There are many insurance companies around the country that only offer Medicare Supplement Insurance in a handful of states. While it’s difficult to find true nationwide coverage, the companies featured on our list are able to serve a majority of the country. However, not all plans will be offered in all places.
Company Integrity
When purchasing something as important as health insurance, it’s vital to select a provider you can trust. Because of this, we focused our search on companies that are widely regarded as trustworthy and have a long history of providing customers with insurance services. To determine this, we looked at factors like awards won, Better Business Bureau ratings, and customer reviews.
For an overview of our findings on the best Medicare Supplement Insurance companies of 2020, take a look at the information in the table below.

Coverage
Humana offers Medicare Supplement plans A, B, C, F, HD-F, K, L, N and provides coverage nationwide, including plans for states with specialized requirements. Not all plans are available in all states, but the company has a simple online tool to help customers find out what’s available in their location. Seniors interested in buying a plan from Humana can do so directly online or call to speak with an agent. The company has created a website that is simple to navigate and understand, and no personal information is required to see quotes.
The online comparison tool makes it easy to compare pricing for Medicare Supplemental Insurance plans and Medicare Advantage, which can be useful if you’re trying to get a feel for pricing on a variety of options. Humana also offers Medicare Part D for those seeking prescription drug coverage.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
The pricing for Medicare Supplement Insurance plans varies from state to state with Humana, but the company generally uses attained-age pricing. Premiums will vary depending on your location, age, tobacco use, and gender. To get a quote, users only need to enter their gender, date of birth, and the desired start date of their coverage.
If you choose to purchase Humana coverage directly from the website, you may be eligible for a small discount.

Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
The majority of states utilize an attained-age pricing structure, but Medicare Supplement Insurance laws vary from state-to-state, others may use community-rated or issue-age-rated structures. Because of this, the prices for available plans will vary. Regardless of where you live, Aetna offers a 12-month rate lock, guaranteeing that premiums will not go up in the first year of coverage.

In addition to offering Medicare Supplement Insurance, Cigna has a proven record of going above and beyond for its customers. The company is dedicated to helping people improve their health and overall well-being, so it includes access to a number of programs and benefits for all customers. The competitive premiums plus the additional benefits make Cigna an excellent overall value.
Coverage
Cigna offers plans A, B, C, D, F, High-Deductible F, G, and N. Coverage is available in all 50 states, but not all plans will be available in all locations because of state laws. The insurance may be provided by any one of a number of Cigna family companies, such as American Retirement Life Insurance, depending on the customer’s location. Customers are able to research and purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance directly on Cigna’s website, but can also reach an agent over the phone to discuss plans.
Cigna’s Medicare Supplement plans do not require customers to use an in-network doctor, so seniors are free to use any healthcare provider who accepts Medicare. The plans provide free access to the Cigna Healthy rewards program, which provides savings on certain wellness products, weight-loss programs, and massage therapy.
The company is also able to offer supplement insurance options that fall outside of the traditional and regulated Medicare Supplement plans. These options include coverage for cancer treatments, accident expenses, heart attacks, and strokes. Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D are also available.

Most Experience Working with Seniors
AARP is a special interest group that has served seniors since 1958. The company was founded with the goal of keeping aging Americans informed, empowered, and independent. Through various programs and services, it works to make the world more accessible and enjoyable for seniors across the country.
AARP is not an insurance company itself, but it does frequently team up with insurance providers to bring seniors affordable and accessible insurance solutions. To provide Medicare Supplement plans, it has teamed up with United Healthcare, an experienced nationwide health insurance company.
Coverage
AARP offers plans A, B, C, F, G, K, L, and N. Plans are available in all 50 states, but the plans that are available will vary by location. Customers only need to enter their zip code to see an estimate for a Medicare Supplement plan with AARP. The website will then display all of the plans available in your area. The premium estimates displayed assume that you are turning 65 and do not use tobacco products, so your actual premium may vary depending on your age and habits. Alternatively, customers can contact an agent to discuss their options over the phone.
Customers will also have the option to purchase Medicare Part D directly through United Healthcare when they sign up for a Medicare Supplement plan if they wish to have coverage for prescription medications.
To qualify for coverage, you must be an AARP member, which comes with an annual fee of $16. The company makes it easy for customers to join AARP at the same time they sign up for Medicare Supplement Insurance. Membership includes access to a lot of extra benefits such as discounted movie tickets, car rentals, hotels, and more.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
AARP generally uses community-rated pricing, which means that a 66-year-old woman in a given area would pay the same amount as a 76-year-old living in the same area. However, since most seniors will get a discount when they enroll at age 65 and the discount decreases every following year, the pricing model ends up being similar to age-attained.
The company offers an enrollment discount in most states of up to 30% for seniors aged 65. The enrollment discount amount decreases by 3% with each year that passes. It also offers a 5% household discount in most states when more than one person in the household is enrolled in one of the available Medicare Supplement Insurance plans through AARP.
The following pricing samples are based on information for a female non-smoker living in Denver, Colorado who is aging into Medicare. While this may not represent the pricing in your area, it can give you an idea of how much it costs to have Medicare Supplement Insurance coverage through AARP.

Best for Medicare Experience
Mutual of Omaha has been offering Medicare Supplement Insurance since Medicare’s inception in 1966, making it one of the most experienced companies when it comes to navigating the Medicare system. The company has a great reputation for offering quality health insurance products across the country.
Owned by its policyholders, Mutual of Omaha also has a reputation for being a company that cares about its customers. The company values excellent service, stating that 98% of all Medicare claims are paid out within 12 hours. The genuine concern for the well-being of its customers combined with its long experience with Medicare makes Mutual of Omaha an excellent choice for Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Coverage
Mutual of Omaha offers plans A, F, HD-F, G, and N. Coverage is available nationwide, although not all plans will be available in all states. It also offers Medicare Part D, making it easy for customers to get coverage for prescription drugs as well. The company has several subsidiary companies, so depending on where a customer lives, policies might be issued by a company of a different name such as United of Omaha.
Getting a quote through the website requires customers to fill out a form with contact information and location. A licensed agent will then reach out to discuss the various options available. For this reason, it’s not a great choice for anyone looking to handle their insurance entirely online.
Policyholders have access to a customer account on the company website which makes it easy to track claims, find policy information, and make payments. The web portal is also host to a library of helpful information, allowing customers to easily find answers to frequently asked questions about coverage and healthcare.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
It’s difficult to obtain pricing quotes from Mutual of Omaha online. Since laws vary from place to place, the company prefers to have agents reach out to potential customers so they can get the information that’s relevant to them. That being said, Mutual of Omaha typically uses attained-age rated pricing where it’s allowed. With attained-age rated pricing, premiums will increase as customers age, so it’s a good idea to compare quotes from various birth years in your area to see how they might increase as you get older.
Mutual of Omaha does offer a household discount of up to 12% for spouses who both have coverage through the company. You can also access the discount if you’ve been living with another individual over the age of 60 for at least one year and that person also has coverage through Mutual of Omaha.
Mutual of Omaha doesn’t offer simplified quotes on its website. In order to learn more about your options and obtain pricing information, you can fill out a contact form and have an agent contact you. Alternatively, you reach out to the company directly by calling 800-205-8193.
Best for Local and In-Person Service
While best known for its catchy car insurance advertisements, State Farm has a wealth of experience providing Medicare Supplement Insurance across the country.
Like most companies, State Farm does offer a tool to get quotes online. However, the company is unique in the way it uses a network of local agents to help customers select plans. There are State Farm offices located throughout the country, and customers are encouraged to use their local agent as a resource for knowledge and assistance. This makes State Farm an excellent choice for customers who prefer the personal touch of local relationships.
Coverage
State Farm currently offers plans A, C, D, F, G, and N. Coverage in 46 states, but not all plans will be available in all states. The company makes it easy to see which plans are available in every location with a simple online tool. Seniors who are interested in purchasing a plan through State Farm only need to fill out a simple form with some basic information to see which options are available to them. The website itself is easy to navigate, and State Farm does a great job of clarifying commonly asked questions throughout the process.
The company does not currently offer vision, dental, or prescription drug plans. So if customers want this type of coverage, they’ll have to find an alternate provider. However, State Farm does offer a variety of other insurance services, which can be helpful if customers are seeking a single provider for things like auto insurance and home insurance in addition to their Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
State Farm’s pricing models vary from place to place, but the company typically uses the attained-age pricing model where it can. This means that prices will increase as you age.
To get a quote, you’ll need to fill out a small form with your basic information. If you want to continue with the process after getting your initial quote, you’ll fill out a contact form and an agent from State Farm will get in touch with you to continue the process. Alternatively, you can find an agent in your area and go through the entire process with them, which is an excellent option for anyone who prefers in-person contacts.
If customers choose to purchase other types of insurance through State Farm, such as auto insurance or property insurance, they may be eligible for a bundle discount. The specific amount will vary depending on what policies are purchased, but it can lead to generous savings on monthly premiums.
To help you get a better picture of what coverage through State Farm costs, we looked at quotes for a non-smoking female living in Portland, Maine who is aging into Medicare.

Best for Budget-Conscious Seniors
Founded in 1992, Anthem has become one of the largest insurance companies in the United States. With one in eight Americans currently holding a policy with Anthem, the company has a reputation for providing an outstanding selection of coverage options at competitive rates.
Anthem Blue Cross offers Medicare Supplement plans at rates that can be significantly lower than the competition. And since plans are closely regulated by state and federal government, customers still have the peace of mind knowing that they have the coverage they need. Combined with a selection of generous discounts, Anthem is an excellent choice for budget-conscious seniors.
Coverage
Anthem currently offers plans A, N, G, and F in 14 states across the country (CA, CO, CT, GA, IN, KY, ME, MO, NH, NV, NY, OH, VA and WI). While Anthem’s coverage is limited to 14 states, it is part of the wider Blue Cross Blue Shield network. This means that if Anthem doesn’t provide coverage in your state, you’ll be directed to a list of companies connected with Blue Cross Blue Shield that do.
Anthem’s website is easy to navigate, and potential customers should find it simple to see exactly what’s available in their area and to obtain a quote. It’s also easy to get in touch with an agent who can provide seniors with more detailed information or walk them through the entire sign up process.
The company also offers Medicare Part D, making it a good choice for seniors who are looking for prescription drug coverage. Additionally, customers will find it easy to bundle their Medicare Supplement Insurance with the company’s vision and dental plans.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
Anthem generally uses the attained-age pricing structure, meaning that premiums will increase as the policyholder ages. However, factors such as gender, location, and tobacco use will affect pricing as well.
Anthem’s price comparison tool makes it easy to compare costs on Medicare Supplement Insurance, Medicare Advantage, and a prescription drug plan. The company also offers dental and vision coverage.
Anthem offers a 5% household discount in most states, meaning that if more than one person in a household is enrolled in a Medicare Supplemental Insurance plan through Anthem, each enrolled individual gets the discount. The company also offers small discounts for enrolling in its monthly electronic payments or for paying for an entire year up-front.
While online quotes are not available in all states, we looked at pricing for a non-smoking female living in Hartford, Connecticut who is aging into Medicare. If online quotes are not available in your region, the website will direct you to contact an agent who can help you further.
Sample Pricing
Coverage in Special States
Out of the three states with specialized Medicare Supplement plans, Anthem Blue Cross only offers coverage in Wisconsin. For a non-smoking female in Madison, Wisconsin the monthly premium is $76.14. The company also offers a variety of additional riders which range in price from $2 to $25 per month.
Most Experienced Insurance Company
ManhattanLife operates four life and health insurance companies that provide coverage to people in all 50 states and Puerto Rico.

Coverage
ManhattanLife currently offers plans A, C, F, G, and N. Coverage is available throughout 35 states as well as Puerto Rico. The availability of each individual plan will vary from state to state. Because ManhattanLife is part of a group, other companies within the group may be able to provide coverage where ManhattanLife can not.
While ManhattanLife does offer some optional coverage selections such as vision and dental, it does not offer Medicare Part D, so customers looking for prescription medication coverage will need to do so with a separate provider.
The company’s website is intuitive to navigate and easy to use. It is very transparent with visitors in describing what each plan contains and what is available in each location, so potential customers won’t need to waste their time trying to figure out if this is the best company for them.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
ManhattanLife does not offer quotes on its website, but it generally utilizes attained-age pricing structure where available. In order to obtain pricing information, customers need to fill out a contact form. After the form is submitted, a licensed agent will reach out and collect relevant information. Potential customers should expect to provide information about their age, location, gender, and tobacco use. The agent can then go into the details of available plans and pricing structures. Alternatively, interested customers can call an agent directly at 800-877-7703 instead of filling out a contact form.
The company does offer a household discount of up to 7% for customers who live with another adult who is also enrolled in a Medicare Supplement Insurance plan from ManhattanLife.

The company prides itself on providing outstanding services and always puts the customer first. It currently holds an A+ (Superior) rating with A.M. Best.
The company offers true nationwide coverage, with plans available in all 50 states. This includes Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, which have specialized Medicare laws. Because of the specialized laws in these states that cause supplement plans to deviate from the common letter plan format, many companies don’t offer plans there. But residents of these states can rest assured that they can find coverage with a reliable, trustworthy company in Transamerica.
Coverage
Transamerica currently offers plans A, F, G, K, and N. Coverage is available in all 50 states and specialized plans are available in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Not all plans will be available in all states.
Transamerica’s plans allow customers to use any doctor across the country that accepts Medicare; there are no network restrictions on any of its plans. While the company does not offer Medicare Part D, it does offer an extensive selection of other insurance and financial planning services including life insurance and retirement planning. This makes Transamerica a good choice for seniors who are also interested in bundling their insurance with other financial planning products.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
Transamerica does not offer any pricing information on its website. In order to get a quote, interested customers need to call and speak directly to an agent. The agent will ask for details about age, location, gender, tobacco use, and coverage start date. More information might be needed to obtain a quote depending on what state the customer lives in, but most people can expect competitive premiums on an attained-age pricing structure.
With Transamerica, discounts will vary depending on location. In many states, customers can get a small discount for enrolling in automatic online payments.
Finding the right Medicare Supplement Insurance provider can be an overwhelming task. There are many different companies offering a wide selection of supplement plans, along with other additional policies. In this buyer’s guide, we’ll walk you through a few simple steps that can help you determine if you need Medicare Supplement Insurance and help you find the company that’s right for you.
Step 1: Determine your Eligibility and if Medicare Supplement Insurance is Right for You
In order to be eligible for a Medicare Supplement plan, you’ll need to have Original Medicare, which is Parts A and B. If you have Medicare Advantage you can not purchase these plans unless you are switching to Original Medicare.
A supplemental insurance plan may be right for you if you wish to add additional coverage that can protect you from unexpected medical expenses in the future. While this means you’ll need to budget for an additional monthly premium, it also means expenses like copayments and deductibles will be covered. Since medical expenses can put a significant strain on your budget, especially if they aren’t planned for, this coverage can provide peace of mind over all of the gaps in Medicare coverage.
Step 2: Understand Your Needs
Once you know that Medicare Supplement Insurance is for you, your next step is to understand your coverage needs. This will depend on several factors, including your current health and financial situation.
For people who are in relatively good health and don’t anticipate needing extensive medical care, plans A, K, and L might be all you need. Since these provide basic coverage, the premiums on these plans tend to be the lowest you can find. C, G, and F fall at the other end of the spectrum with full coverage and generally high premiums. The official U.S. Government website for Medicare provides a detailed chart that can help you understand exactly what each supplement plan covers.
If you are looking for lower premiums, you’ll also want to keep Select plans in mind. These plans offer lower monthly premiums, but you’ll only be able to choose providers from a small, preapproved list.
Step 3: Consider Additional Services and Benefits
If you’re shopping solely for a Medicare Supplement plan, additional services and member benefits may not impact your decisions. But it’s worth considering what other services you might need or could benefit from going forward.
You’ll find that many companies offer Medicare Part D, which is essential if you’re looking for prescription drug coverage. You may also wish to find a company that offers vision, dental, and hearing insurance options so you do not have to go through multiple companies.
Many companies also offer other insurance services such as life, property, home, and auto. If these are insurance services that you need, you might find it convenient to use the same company. You may also be able to get a bundle discount if you hold multiple policies with a single company.
Additionally, some companies offer customers member benefits. These benefits vary from company to company but can include discounts on glasses, wellness products, gym memberships, and travel expenses. Several companies also offer wellness coaching and access to a nurse for health advice.
Step 4: Compare Companies and Gather Quotes
Now that you know what you need, you can narrow your search down to companies that offer what you’re looking for. You should get quotes from at least 3 different companies before making a decision because prices can vary significantly. While many companies offer quotes online, calling an agent can clear up confusion and be a great way to test whether or not you like working with the people at the company.
While comparing quotes, you should also ask about available discounts. Many companies do not advertise discounts directly on their website but will grant them to customers who live in eligible locations when asked. Some common discounts include a household discount when more than one person gets coverage through the company, no tobacco use discounts, automatic payment discounts, annual payment discounts, and new enrollment discounts.
This is also a good time to evaluate the kind of service the company provides. Some companies provide access to local agents, while others are entirely online and over-the-phone operations. You should spend some time on the company’s website to see if you’re comfortable using it as well, since there’s a good chance you’ll be visiting it often to track claims and make payments.
Step 5: Sign Up for Your Chosen Plans During Open Enrollment
It’s important to sign up for your Medicare Supplement plans during your open enrollment period, which is the 6-month period following your 65th birthday. This not only helps to keep your costs as low as possible, but it protects you from being denied coverage for preexisting health conditions.
Each Medicare Supplement plan is standardized, meaning that it must conform with both federal and state laws. These laws are in place to protect customers, and each plan must offer the same basic benefits. You’ll find that some policies may offer additional benefits, allowing you to choose a plan that better meets your individual needs.
While each insurance company decides which supplement plans it wants to offer, state laws may affect what is offered in your area. Insurance companies do not need to offer every policy, but the federal government requires all companies offering Medicare Supplement plans to offer Plan A.
The chart below will give you a quick overview of exactly what each nationwide plan covers.
A note on plans C & F: Beginning on January 1, 2020, plans C & F will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare. However, if you already have either plan your coverage will continue as normal. Additionally, if you were eligible for Medicare before this date but not enrolled yet, you may still be able to access one of these plans.
In the following section you’ll find a brief overview of each Medicare Supplement Plan.
Plan A
Since the federal government requires all insurance companies to offer Plan A if they sell supplemental policies, it’s the most common and generally has the lowest premiums.
Plan A includes coverage for:
Plan B
Plan B is nearly identical to Plan A, but it also includes coverage for Part A deductibles.
Plan C
Plan C includes coverage for a number of additional expenses, including:
As of January 1, 2020, Plan C will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare.
Plan D
Plan D is nearly identical to Plan C, but it does not cover Part B deductibles. Since Plan C is being phased out in 2020, it’s an ideal alternative if you’re seeking that level of coverage.
Plan F
Plan F is considered a “full coverage” plan. It includes:
As of January 1, 2020, Plan F will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare.
Plan G
Plan G is nearly identical to Plan F, but it does not cover Part B deductibles. Since Plan F is being phased out in 2020, Plan G is an ideal alternative for anyone seeking a “full coverage” plan.
Plan K
Plan K is a low coverage with less expensive premiums. It fully covers Part A coinsurance & hospital costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits stop, as well as 50% of the following costs:
Starting in 2020, Plan K will have an out-of-pocket spending limit of $5,880. Once you’ve reached this amount, your plan will cover 100% of your eligible expenses.
Plan L
Plan L is similar to Plan K, but it offers slightly more coverage. It fully covers Part A coinsurance and hospital costs up to 365 days after medicare benefits stop. It also covers 75% of the following costs:
Starting in 2020, Plan L will have an out-of-pocket spending limit of $2,940. Once you’ve reached this amount, your plan will cover 100% of your eligible expenses.
Plan M
Plan M is a medium-coverage plan that includes the following:
Plan N
Plan N is similar to Plan M, with a few minor differences. In this plan, you’ll have coverage for:
If you live in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, or Minnesota, you’ll find that Medicare Supplement Insurance is standardized in different ways. Each state has its own requirements that differ from the letter plans more commonly used across the country and use their own list of Basic Benefits that each plan must cover.
In Massachusetts, Basic Benefits include:
There are two supplement plans available in the state: the Core Plan and Supplement Plan 1.
For a quick side-by-side overview of the plans available in Massachusetts, refer to the table below.
Core Plan
The simplest plan available in Massachusetts is the Core Plan. This includes:
Supplement 1 Plan
Those looking for additional coverage may opt for the Supplement 1 Plan, which includes:
In Wisconsin, Basic Benefits include:
Basic Plan
Wisconsin’s basic plan includes coverage for:
Cost-Sharing Plans
If you would like more coverage than what’s included in the Basic Plan, you have the option to enroll in 25% and 50% cost-sharing plans. Similar to standardized Plans K and L, these cost sharing plans cover 25% or 50% of certain eligible expenses. A high-deductible plan is also available.
Optional Riders
Some insurance providers in Wisconsin offer riders that allow you to customize your supplement plan. These riders include coverage for:
In Minnesota, Basic Benefits include:
There are two supplement plans available in Minnesota: the Basic Plan and the Extended Basic Plan. For a quick side-by-side overview of these plans, refer to the chart below.
*Plan will cover 100% of expenses after you’ve paid $1,000 out-of-pocket in a calendar year.
Basic Plan
Enrolling in the Basic Plan gets you coverage for:
Extended Basic Benefits
Those looking for more coverage might opt for the Extended Basic Benefits Plan. This plan includes coverage for:
Additional Plans and Riders
There are also Minnesota versions of Plans high-deductible F, K, L, M, and N available.
Companies may also offer riders that can be added on to Basic Plan to further customize coverage. These riders include:
When should I purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance?
You’ll want to purchase your Medicare Supplement Insurance during the open enrollment period. Open enrollment is the 6-month period following your 65th birthday. During this timeframe, you’ll be able to enroll in any plan, regardless of any preexisting conditions. If you wait until after this period ends to purchase coverage, you may be faced with higher premiums and companies can deny you coverage.
How much does Medicare Supplement Insurance cost?
Medicare Supplement Insurance prices vary widely from place to place. Other factors like gender, level of coverage, age, and tobacco use can also affect the total cost of a plan. Because of this, there is no one number that accurately estimates the cost. You may be able to find plans that cost less than $100 per month if you’re in search of basic coverage, but you may also encounter plans that cost close to $1,000 or more if you’re looking for maximum protection. This is why it’s important to get quotes from a variety of companies before making a decision.
Am I required to purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance?
No, no one is required to purchase any Medicare Supplement Insurance plans. However, it’s important to keep in mind that Medicare does not cover 100% of your healthcare costs. Even if you’re in relatively good health now, there’s no knowing what will happen in the future, and out-of-pocket medical expenses can quickly become a serious financial strain. Because of this, some form of coverage is recommended.
Are there any savings available for Medicare Supplement Insurance?
Yes, there are various discounts offered by companies that provide Medicare Supplement Insurance. The most common discount is for non-smokers, since people who don’t use tobacco tend to have fewer health problems. Household discounts are also popular, giving people a percentage off of their monthly premiums if they live with another senior who has coverage through the same company. As you shop, you may also find that some companies offer discounts for paying annually or setting up automatic monthly payments.
Where can I go for more information?If you need more assistance or information regarding Medicare, there are a number of different sources available. Medicare.gov is a website managed by the federal government and is an excellent source of information regarding Medicare and Medicare Supplement Insurance. There, you can find forms, resources, compare plans, and find local sources of assistance. Alternatively, you can visit your state’s government website to find more information and locate resources that are close to you.",Medicare Supplement Insurance,10

Because Original Medicare covers a significant portion of its recipients’ healthcare expenses, eligibility for Medicare is a welcome milestone. But for all that Medicare covers, its enrollees learn quickly that Original Medicare doesn’t pick up the tab for everything.
What is Medicare supplement insurance?
Medicare enrollees typically find that they need help with many Medicare expenses – including copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles, in addition to any medical expenses incurred during travel outside the United States and its territories. To cover those expenses, millions of people – more than a third of all Original Medicare beneficiaries – purchase Medicare supplement insurance, also known as Medigap. These plans are designed to fill in the gaps in Medicare and limit enrollees’ out-of-pocket exposure.
Where can you buy Medigap coverage?
Medigap policies are available in every state, from private health insurance carriers. America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) reported in 2019 that total Medigap enrollment in 2017 stood at 13.5 million – up from 11.6 million in 2014.
All Medigap insurers must abide by strict state and federal laws. In most states, Medigap carriers must offer standardized policies that are identified by the letters “A” through “N.” There are a total of ten different plan designs: A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, and although the price varies from one carrier to another, the plan benefits are the same from one state to another and from one carrier to another, within each letter. (As described below, Plans C and F are no longer available to newly eligible enrollees.) So all plan Gs, for example, offer the same benefits — regardless of where you live or what insurance carrier you use. (Medigap policies in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are standardized in a different way.)
In some states, not all types of Medigap coverage will be available. In other states, you may be able to purchase Medicare SELECT – a Medigap policy that requires plan holders to use specific hospitals and, in some cases, specific doctors. Any of the ten Medigap plan designs can be offered as a Medicare SELECT plan, and they tend to be less expensive than typical Medigap policies due to the restricted network. If you choose a Medicare SELECT plan and use a provider that’s not in the network, your Medigap plan won’t pick up your Medicare out-of-pocket costs unless it’s an emergency.
It’s important to note that insurance companies offering Medigap policies are not required to offer every Medigap policy. However, if a carrier offers any Medigap policy, it is required to also offer at least Medigap Plan A, as well as either Plan D or Plan G if the enrollee is new to Medicare, and either Plan C or Plan F if the enrollee became eligible for Medicare prior to 2020.
Are there gaps in Medigap coverage?
Yes. Medigap plans are designed to cover some or all of the out-of-pocket expenses for services that Medicare covers. But they do not cover care that’s not covered at all by Medicare. The list of expenses that Medigap policies don’t cover includes long-term care in a nursing home, vision and dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, private-duty nursing care, or prescription drugs. (Plans purchased prior to 2006 were allowed to cover prescriptions, and if you’ve still got one of those plans, you’re allowed to keep it. But Medigap plans sold since 2006 cannot include prescription coverage.)
Also, Medigap policies aren’t compatible with the following types of coverage:
- employer or union plans; veterans’ benefits;
- Indian health services;
- Medicare Advantage plans;
- Medicare prescription drug plans (you’ll need a prescription drug plan in addition to the Medigap policy, since they cover different things.); and
- Medicaid.
Finally, Medigap policies are for individuals only – not for couples or families. So if you and your spouse are both eligible for Medicare, you’ll each need to select an individual Medigap plan. (Some carriers offer a discount if both spouses select the same plan.)
Can new beneficiaries buy Medigap plans that cover the Part B deductible?
There are two Medigap plan designs – Plan F and Plan C – that cover the Medicare Part B deductible. As a result of HR2 (MACRA), which was signed into law in 2015, those plans are no longer available to people who weren’t already eligible for Medicare prior to 2020.
People who were already enrolled in Plan C and Plan F can keep their coverage. And people who were Medicare-eligible prior to the start of 2020 can still apply for Plan C or Plan F. (If they’re outside of their initial enrollment window, carriers will likely use medical underwriting to determine eligibility.)
But people who become eligible for Medicare in 2020 or beyond can no longer purchase Plan C or Plan F. The idea was to eliminate first-dollar coverage under Medigap plans in an effort to prevent over-utilization of healthcare (ie, ensure that enrollees have some “skin in the game” rather than having all of their costs covered by Medicare and supplemental coverage). So people who become eligible for Medicare in 2020 or later can still buy Medigap plans that cover nearly all of their out-of-pocket costs for Medicare-covered services, but they will have to pay the Part B deductible on their own if and when they need outpatient care.
As of 2020, the Part B deductible is $198. (The Part B deductible is a per-year charge, as Medicare’s benefit periods only apply to inpatient care under Medicare Part A.)
How do Medigap insurers set their prices?
The cost of a Medigap policy can vary with each insurance company. There are three ways in which insurers set Medigap rates:
- With community-rated pricing, enrollees are charged the same premium regardless of age. So a 65-year-old enrollee will pay the same premium as an 85-year-old enrollee. Premiums can change over time, but they change by the same amount for all enrollees. There are eight states that require all Medigap plans to be community rated.
- Issue-age-rated premiums are based on the age of the purchaser. So the older the person is at the time of purchase, the higher the premium, and that difference continues as long as they have the plan. For plans with this rating structure, it’s particularly important to enroll as soon as you’re eligible for Medicare coverage, because your premium will always be as low as possible that way.
- With attained-age-rated pricing, the premium goes up as the insured person ages. These plans might be the least expensive option when you’re first eligible for coverage, since you’ll be among the youngest enrollees. But as you get older, the price will increase based on your age as well as factors like inflation and overall medical cost trends.
Be aware that Medigap plans in most states are only guaranteed issue during the six-month window that starts the month you turn 65 (or when you enroll in Medicare Part B, which might be after you turn 65 if you still had employer-sponsored coverage), and during limited special enrollment periods. There’s no annual open enrollment period like there is for Medicare Advantage, Medicare D, and Original Medicare.
If you don’t enroll during your initial enrollment period, you may have to pay a higher premium – or be declined altogether – if you’re in poor health, as carriers are allowed to use medical underwriting after your initial enrollment period has passed.
How can I pay less for Medigap coverage?
Make sure you enroll as soon as you’re eligible, in order to get coverage that’s guaranteed issue with no premium rate-ups based on your medical history.
Some Medigap carriers offer discounts that might apply to you. Some insurers offer discounts for women, non-smokers, married people, and for paying annually. States also offer a health insurance assistance program, providing up-to-date Medigap insurance information and a list of qualified private insurers. Check our state pages to find your state’s assistance program.
Is there a best time to purchase a Medigap policy?
The best window of time in which to buy a Medigap policy begins on the first day of the month in which you’re at least 65 and enrolled in Medicare A and B (you have to be enrolled in both Medicare A and B in order to get a Medigap plan). This is the start of your initial enrollment period, and it lasts for six months. Under federal rules, Medigap coverage in every state is guaranteed during this window.
If you’re eligible for Medicare because of a disability, the majority of the states offer at least some sort of guaranteed issue enrollment periods for those under 65. (In many cases the coverage is more expensive for those under 65. You can click on your state on this map to see how the rules work.) So it pays to research your state’s health care regulations. (Contact your state SHIP office or Department of Insurance for more details).
If you wait to buy a policy until after your initial enrollment period, your carrier generally has the option of denying the application or charging a higher premium based on the company’s underwriting requirements, as there is no federal requirement that Medigap plans be guaranteed-issue outside of the initial enrollment window and very limited special enrollment periods. But states can set their own regulations for Medigap plans:
- In New York and Connecticut, Medigap plans are not medically underwritten, regardless of when an applicant enrolls.
- In Massachusetts, there’s an annual guaranteed-issue Medigap open enrollment period each year, from February 1 through March 31.
- In Maine, Medigap insurers must designate one month each year when Plan A is guaranteed issue, regardless of the applicant’s medical history.
- Missouri‘s “anniversary rule” allows enrollees to switch from one Medigap insurer to another (as long as both plans are the same letter) on a guaranteed-issue basis during a window each year that extends for 30 days before and 30 days after the anniversary of when the plan was first purchased.
- In California and Oregon, Medigap enrollees have a 30-day window each year, following the enrollee’s birthday, when he or she can switch to any other available Medigap plan that has equal or lesser benefits, without medical underwriting.
- Washington State allows those already enrolled in Medigap plans to switch to another Medigap plan at any time, as long as they’ve had coverage for at least 90 days. Those with Medigap Plan A are limited to switching to only another Plan A. But people with Medigap Plans B through N can switch to any other Plan B through N.
Check with your state SHIP or your state’s Department of Insurance for more information about state-based regulations regarding Medigap.
Will I have to wait for my Medigap policy to take effect?
An insurer can’t make you wait for your coverage to start, but it can make you wait for coverage of a pre-existing condition – and may also refuse to cover your out-of-pocket costs for that pre-existing condition for up to six months during a pre-existing condition waiting period. That said, if you recently had “credible coverage” – or if you have guaranteed issue “Medigap protection” – you may be able to shorten or avoid entirely the waiting period.

Here’s the Gist:
Original Medicare (Part A and B) doesn’t have an out-of-pocket limit, but some Medicare Supplement Plans do. This means that after you reach this limit, some Medicare Supplement Plans will cover the rest of the cost of all covered health care services for the rest of the year.
Medicare Supplement Plans have premiums that cost anywhere from around $70/month to around $270/month. Typically, plans with higher monthly premiums will have lower deductibles. Plans with lower monthly premiums typically have higher deductibles.
Read on to learn how you can save on out-of-pocket Original Medicare costs by enrolling in a Medicare Supplement Plan.
When you found out that Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) has no out of pocket maximum, you might have become interested in a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan.
A Medicare Supplement plan helps limit your Medicare out of pocket cost by covering some copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. Some Medicare Supplement plans even have out of pocket limits, meaning they will pay all your covered medical expenses once you’ve paid a certain amount. However, to potentially save money through a Medicare Supplement plan, you first must pay for it. The first way you pay is through a monthly premium.
What is the Medicare Supplement plan premium?
Medicare Supplement plans generally charge premiums, which is a monthly amount you pay to be covered, whether or not you use covered services. The amount of the monthly premium can vary widely. Some plans might charge $70/month for example and some plans might charge $270/month.
What determines the Medicare Supplement plan premium?
Factors that can influence the Medicare Supplement plan price are:
- Which plan you want: there are up to ten Medicare Supplement plans available labeled A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M and N. Medicare Supplement plan A doesn’t cover everything that Medicare Supplement plan F covers, for example. Plans with more coverage may cost more.
- Which insurance company offers the plan
- The geographic area the plan covers
- How the plan is “rated” which is how they factor your age into your cost. Some plans charge the same monthly premium to everyone, regardless of age. Some plans charge according to the age you are when you buy the plan, and some plans charge according to your current age so your premium may increase yearly.
What is a Medicare Supplement deductible?
You may know the word “deductible” from other types of insurance you already have, such as auto insurance. A deductible is an amount you pay before your insurance plan begins to pay. Some Medicare Supplement plans pay the Medicare Part A hospital deductible, but make you pay the Medicare Part B medical deductible. Some plans cover neither the Part A nor the Part B deductible and you will be responsible for those costs out of pocket.
Medicare Supplement high deductible plan F* may charge a lower monthly premium than other plans. However, this low premium may be attached to a high deductible, meaning you must pay a significant amount out of pocket before your Medicare Supplement plan pays anything.
What are other Medicare Supplement plan costs?
Having a Medicare Supplement plan unfortunately doesn’t mean that all your Medicare costs will be covered. You still must pay your Medicare Part B premium and may owe a Medicare Part A premium as well. There is also a limit on what coinsurance costs your Medicare Supplement plan may cover. For example, if you stay in the hospital over 365 days, you may be responsible for all costs. Similarly, if you stay in a skilled nursing facility over 100 days, you may be responsible for all costs. The only way to have a known limit on your costs is to get a plan with an out of pocket maximum.

A Medigap policy is health insurance sold by private insurance companies to fill the “gaps” in Original Medicare Plan coverage. Medigap policies help pay some of the health care costs that the Original Medicare Plan doesn't cover. If you are in the Original Medicare Plan and have a Medigap policy, then Medicare and your Medigap policy will each pay its share of covered health care costs.
Generally, when you buy a Medigap policy you must have Medicare Part A and Part B. You will have to pay the monthly Medicare Part B premium. In addition, you will have to pay a premium to the Medigap insurance company. As long as you pay your premium, your Medigap policy is guaranteed renewable. This means it is automatically renewed each year. Your coverage will continue year after year as long as you pay your premium. In some states, insurance companies may refuse to renew a Medigap policy bought before 1992.
Insurance companies can only sell you a “standardized” Medigap policy. Medigap policies must follow Federal and state laws. These laws protect you. The front of a Medigap policy must clearly identify it as “Medicare Supplement Insurance.”
It's important to compare Medigap policies, because costs can vary. The standardized Medigap policies that insurance companies offer must provide the same benefits. Generally, the only difference between Medigap policies sold by different insurance companies is the cost.
You and your spouse must buy separate Medigap policies.Your Medigap policy won't cover any health care costs for your spouse.
Some Medigap policies also cover other extra benefits that aren't covered by Medicare.
You are guaranteed the right to buy a Medigap policy under certain circumstances.
For more information on Medigap policies, you may call 1-800-633-4227 and ask for a free copy of the publication “Choosing a Medigap Policy: A Guide to Health Insurance for People With Medicare.” You may also call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) and your State Insurance Department.

27,https://www.medicaremadeclear.com/basics/medicare-supplement-insurance-costs-and-coverage,"There are 10 standardized Medicare supplement insurance plans, labeled “A” through “N.” (These letters are not related to the Medicare Part A, B, C and D labels.) The plans and what they cover are prescribed by the federal government. What Does Medicare Supplement Insurance Cover?
The main purpose of a Medicare supplement plan is to cover some of the out-of-pocket costs not paid by Medicare Parts A and B, like deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance. Each of the standardized plans provides benefits for different out-of-pocket costs.
Each standardized plan with the same letter must offer the same basic benefits, no matter which insurance company sells it. For example the basic benefits of one company’s Plan F are the same as the basic benefits of another company’s Plan F. The only difference between Medicare supplement plans with the same letter sold by different insurance companies is usually cost.
What Does Medicare Supplement Insurance Cost?
The table shows the types of costs you may have with a Medicare supplement insurance plan. You need to look at individual plans to understand their specific costs. How Medicare Supplement Insurance Works
Each standardized Medicare supplement insurance plan covers different types of out-of-pocket costs. So what you pay in out-of-pocket costs will depend on what services you use and which plan you have.
This is a little confusing, so let’s use an example.
Suppose a person has Original Medicare (Parts A and B) and receives the following covered services:
- 15 days as an inpatient in the hospital
- 22 days in a skilled nursing facility
- 2 visits with a doctor who doesn’t accept Medicare assignment
The table below compares what the person's out-of-pocket cost for these services might be with different Medicare supplement insurance plans.This example assumes that the Part B deductible is met for the year. The costs shown are for illustration only. Actual costs may be different.
So depending on which Medicare supplement insurance plan the person in this example has, some or all of their out-of-pocket costs could be covered. In general, plans that cover more costs have higher premiums.
Enrolling in a Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan
You have a specific enrollment period for Medicare supplement insurance called the Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period. This period:
- Begins the first month that you are age 65 or older and enrolled in Medicare Part B
- Lasts for 6 months
- Guarantees your right to buy a plan (You cannot be denied coverage if you apply during this period.)
Even if you miss your open enrollment period, you may apply for Medicare supplement insurance at any time. You could be denied coverage, though, or charged a higher premium based on your health history. Some states have additional Medicare supplement open enrollment periods, including for beneficiaries under age 65.",Medicare Supplement Insurance,15
