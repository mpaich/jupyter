 Medicare Program - General Information\nMedicare is a health insurance program for:\n- People age 65 or older.\n- People under age 65 with certain disabilities.\n- People of all ages with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant).\nMedicare has different parts that help cover specific services:\nMedicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) - Part A helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some home health care. Beneficiaries must meet certain conditions to get these benefits. Most people don't pay a premium for Part A because they or a spouse already paid for it through their payroll taxes while working.\nMedicare Part B (Medical Insurance) - Part B helps cover doctors' services and outpatient care. It also covers some other medical services that Part A doesn't cover, such as some of the services of physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care.

 Medicare.gov\nMedicare.gov is the official United States government website for all things Medicare. The site is a rich resource for all the different stages of your Medicare experience, both when you’re first eligible and when you’re looking to explore your coverage options. Here, you can find in-depth information that explains your coverage and how the program works.\nMedicare.gov is broken out into several main sections that allow you to drill down further for a richer experience, depending on your specific interests. Some of the information you may find on the site includes:\n- Sign Up/Change Plans: Covers all available Medicare options, defines the difference between Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) and Medicare Advantage plans, and explains when enrollment periods are available.\n- Your Medicare Costs: Explores the various costs associated with Medicare coverage and includes information on payment options and financial assistance for low-income beneficiaries.\n- What Medicare Covers: Explains what services are covered under the various Medicare coverage options.\n- Drug Coverage (Part D) : Covers the prescription drug benefit, including how to enroll and the different ways you can get this coverage.\n- Supplements and Other Insurance: Specifies how Medicare works with other insurance, including retiree insurance and Medicare Supplement (Medigap) coverage.\n- Claims and Appeals: Provides information for filing complaints (grievances), claims, and appeals. Also includes frequently asked questions and an explanation of your rights, options, and protections as a Medicare beneficiary.\n- Manage Your Health: Allows users to create a login for MyMedicare.gov, a portal that helps beneficiaries manage their Medicare coverage; you can also get access to information on Medicare forms, electronic prescribing, and care coordination. This section also includes long-term care and advance directives information.\n- Forms, Help & Resources: Includes sections where users can check their enrollment, find Medicare health & drug plans, and locate doctors, hospitals, and other facilities that provide care to beneficiaries.\nAdditional resources on Medicare.gov\nMedicare.gov features content that covers all aspects of the Medicare program, including the various Medicare insurance plan types available for additional coverage. For those who are new to Medicare, the site provides information on Medicare eligibility for beneficiaries who qualify by age, disability, or certain health conditions (such as Lou Gehrig’s disease or end-stage renal disease). For those who are interested in enrolling in Medicare coverage, the site offers information explaining the various Medicare enrollment periods and what special circumstances may apply when enrolling outside of the regular periods.\nIn addition to navigating Medicare.gov on your own, you can find specific information by using the search bar available on every page. Users who prefer to read through a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) may do that as well. If you’re ever stuck and can’t find the answers you need, Medicare.gov has a Help page with information on how to contact their customer service.\nMedicare.gov isn’t your only option when it comes to learning more about your Medicare plan options and finding coverage. Perhaps you’d like to add a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan to work alongside your Original Medicare coverage. Or, alternatively, you may be interested in enrolling in a Medicare Advantage plan because of the additional benefits (like routine vision or dental) that these plans may provide. If you’d like help finding Medicare plan options, that’s what we’re here for.
