Medicare is the federal health insurance program for:
- People who are 65 or older
- Certain younger people with disabilities
- People with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD)
The different parts of Medicare help cover specific services:
Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance)
Part A covers inpatient hospital stays, care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and some home health care.
Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance)
Part B covers certain doctors' services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services.
Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage)
Part D adds prescription drug coverage to:
- Original Medicare
- Some Medicare Cost Plans
- Some Medicare Private-Fee-for-Service Plans
- Medicare Medical Savings Account Plans
These plans are offered by insurance companies and other private companies approved by Medicare. Medicare Advantage Plans may also offer prescription drug coverage that follows the same rules as Medicare Prescription Drug Plans.

3,https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/original-medicare,"- Part A provides inpatient/hospital coverage.
- Part B provides outpatient/medical coverage.
- Part C offers an alternate way to receive your Medicare benefits (see below for more information).
- Part D provides prescription drug coverage.
Generally, the different parts of Medicare help cover specific services. Most beneficiaries choose to receive their Parts A and B benefits through Original Medicare, the traditional fee-for-service program offered directly through the federal government. It is sometimes called Traditional Medicare or Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare. Under Original Medicare, the government pays directly for the health care services you receive. You can see any doctor and hospital that takes Medicare (and most do) anywhere in the country.
In Original Medicare:
- You go directly to the doctor or hospital when you need care. You do not need to get prior permission/authorization from Medicare or your primary care doctor.
- You are responsible for a monthly premium for Part B. Some also pay a premium for Part A.
- You typically pay a coinsurance for each service you receive.
- There are limits on the amounts that doctors and hospitals can charge for your care.
If you want prescription drug coverage with Original Medicare, in most cases you will need to actively choose and join a stand-alone Medicare private drug plan (PDP).
Note: There are a number of government programs that may help reduce your health care and prescription drug costs if you meet the eligibility requirements.
Unless you choose otherwise, you will have Original Medicare. Instead of Original Medicare, you can decide to get your Medicare benefits from a Medicare Advantage Plan, also called Part C or Medicare private health plan. Remember, you still have Medicare if you enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan. This means that you must still pay your monthly Part B premium (and your Part A premium, if you have one). Each Medicare Advantage Plan must provide all Part A and Part B services covered by Original Medicare, but they can do so with different rules, costs, and restrictions that can affect how and when you receive care.
It is important to understand your Medicare coverage choices and to pick your coverage carefully. How you choose to get your benefits and who you get them from can affect your out-of-pocket costs and where you can get your care. For instance, in Original Medicare, you are covered to go to nearly all doctors and hospitals in the country. On the other hand, Medicare Advantage Plans typically have network restrictions, meaning that you will likely be more limited in your choice of doctors and hospitals. However, Medicare Advantage Plans can also provide additional benefits that Original Medicare does not cover, such as routine vision or dental care.",Medcare Coverage,4
4,https://www.healthline.com/health/what-medicare-covers,"5 Things You Might Not Know About Medicare
When it comes to healthcare, it’s important to know what is covered and what isn’t. Because there are so many different plans for Medicare, it can be confusing to know which plan will give you the right coverage. Fortunately, there are some tools that can make it easier for you.
Medicare is the insurance plan offered by the federal government for people aged 65 and over, as well as people with disabilities, and people who have permanent kidney failure.
There are four parts to the Medicare plan: A, B, C, and D. Each part covers different aspects of healthcare. You can enroll in one or more parts of Medicare, but the most common parts people enroll in are Parts A and B, as these cover the majority of services. People usually have to pay a monthly premium, but this varies widely based on income.
Medicare Part A, also called “original Medicare,” is the insurance plan that covers hospital stays and services. It also covers stays in skilled nursing facilities, walkers and wheelchairs, and hospice care. It even covers home healthcare services if you’re unable to get to a hospital or skilled nursing facility. If you need a blood transfusion, Part A covers the cost of the blood.
Medicare Part A covers hospital inpatient costs. However, just because you visit a hospital doesn’t mean that you’re an inpatient. An overnight stay doesn’t mean you’re an inpatient either.
- You’re an inpatient when you’re formally admitted to a hospital with a doctor’s order.
- You’re an outpatient if you receive any type of hospital services without being formally admitted to a hospital with a doctor’s order. This may include emergency services, outpatient surgery, lab tests, and X-rays. In these cases, you’re an outpatient even if you stay overnight at the hospital.
Make sure you know if you’re an inpatient or outpatient, as this will affect your coverage.
Also, Medicare Part A will only cover a skilled nursing facility if you have a qualifying inpatient hospital stay — three consecutive days resulting from a formal inpatient admission order written by your doctor.
What Medicare Part A costs
Depending on your income, you may have to pay a premium for Part A coverage. You may also have to pay copayments or a deductible for any services under Medicare Part A. You can apply for assistance or help if you can’t pay. Beginning in 2017, in general, these are the costs for each service:
- Hospital services: $1,316 for up to 60 days, $329 per day for 61-90 days, and $658 per day for stays beyond 91 days
- Skilled nursing facilities: No charge for the first 20 days, $164.50 per day for 21-100 days, and all costs after 101 days
- Hospice care: No charge for hospice care, $5 copayment for medication, and 5 percent for inpatient respite care (periodic care so your caretaker can rest)
Remember, you have to be approved for these services and you have to make sure you are in an approved facility.
Medicare Part B is also a part of “original Medicare” and it covers your doctor services and preventive healthcare, such as yearly doctor visits and tests. People often have Parts A and B together to get the most coverage. For example, if you stay in a hospital, the stay would be covered under Medicare Part A and the doctor’s services would be covered under Part B.
Part B covers a wide range of tests and services, including:
- screening for cancer, depression, and diabetes
- ambulance and emergency department services
- influenza and hepatitis vaccinations
- electrocardiograms (ECGs)
- medical equipment
- some drugs, diabetes supplies, and some prescriptions for eyewear
What Medicare Part B costs
If you have Part A, chances are you will have to also buy Part B coverage as well. For Part B beginning in 2017, most people will have to pay a monthly premium of $134 a month. This could be more or less depending on your income.
Some services are covered under Medicare Part B at no additional cost to you if you see a doctor that accepts Medicare. If you need a service outside of what is covered by Medicare, you will have to pay for that service. Services from doctors who do not accept Medicare may cost more and you might have to pay the full amount up-front. If some of the cost is covered, you will get paid back through a claims process.
Medicare Part C plans, also called Medicare Advantage plans, are supplemental plans that provide more coverage for an additional cost. They are private insurance plans approved by Medicare that fill in the gaps in services and hospital care. People with Medicare Part C must already be enrolled with Parts A and B.
Under these plans, you can get prescription drug coverage, dental and eye coverage, and other benefits.
You usually pay a premium for these plans, and you have to see doctors within your network. Otherwise, copayments or other fees may apply. The cost depends on the type of plan you select.
Medicare Part D is the plan that covers prescription drugs not covered by Part B, which are typically the kind of medications that need to be administered by a doctor, like an infusion or injection. This plan is optional, but many people choose to have it so their medications are covered.
The cost for Medicare Part D varies depending on what kinds of medications you take, the plan you have, and which pharmacy you choose. You will have a premium to pay and, depending on your income, you may have to pay additional costs. You may also have to make copayments or pay a deductible.
While Medicare covers a wide range of care, not everything is covered. Most dental care, eye exams, hearing aids, acupuncture, and any cosmetic surgeries are not covered by Medicare Parts A and B.
Long-term care is also not covered by Medicare. If you think you or a loved one will need long-term care, consider a separate long-term care (LTC) insurance policy.
If you’re getting ready to enroll in Medicare, be sure you select the plan that best fits your healthcare needs. If you’re already enrolled and unsure about what’s covered, use the Medicare website to see if your treatment is covered. Don’t be afraid to ask questions!",Medcare Coverage,5
5,https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/medicare/coverage-all/understanding-basics-medicare-coverage,"Understanding the Basics of Medicare Coverage
Medicare is a government-sponsored health insurance program for American citizens and permanent legal residents (of at least five years in a row) who are 65 years old or more, or who qualify by disability or certain conditions, such as end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring continuous dialysis treatment or a kidney transplant) or Lou Gehrig’s disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The basic program is called Original Medicare and includes Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance).
What does Medicare cover?
When we say that Medicare covers a service or item, we mean that Medicare may pay at least a portion of the service or item under certain conditions. In most cases, a service must be delivered in a Medicare-enrolled facility by a Medicare-assigned provider.
- Medicare Part A, hospital insurance, covers services such as (but not limited to) inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, hospice services, and limited home health care.
- Medicare Part B, medical insurance, covers services and supplies such as (but not limited to) outpatient care, mental health services, lab tests, doctor visits, durable medical equipment, and preventive services.
What are my Medicare coverage options?
In a nutshell, here are your basic choices for Medicare coverage.
- Stay with Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) and do nothing else. A few things to be aware of:You get Medicare Part A premium-free if you’ve worked at least 10 years, or 40 quarters, while paying Medicare taxes.Most people pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part B. You can decide not to enroll in this part of Original Medicare. Some people “opt out” of Part B coverage if they have group health coverage through an employer, for example. You can sign up for Part B later when you stop working or your group coverage ends. But you must be enrolled in Part B if you want to sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medicare Supplement plan. If you delay enrollment in Part B, you might face a late-enrollment penalty for as long as you have the coverage, unless you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period.Outside of certain specific situations, Original Medicare doesn’t cover prescription drugs. Medicare plan options to cover prescription drugs are discussed below.Original Medicare does come with certain out-of-pocket costs. Medicare Part A and Part B have deductibles and sometimes coinsurance, copayments, and certain coverage limits.
- Stay with Original Medicare and add a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan to help pay for Original Medicare’s out-of-pocket costs.
- Stay with Original Medicare and sign up for a stand-alone Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan, available from private, Medicare-approved insurance companies.
- Get your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits through a Medicare Advantage plan instead of directly from the government. Many Medicare Advantage plans also cover routine vision or dental care or other benefits. Hospice care is covered directly by Medicare Part A when you have a Medicare Advantage plan.The types of Medicare Advantage plans available in your area may include Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans, and others.Most Medicare Advantage plans include prescription drug coverage; these are called Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans. If you enroll in this type of plan, you can get all your Medicare benefits through a single plan. You still need to keep paying your monthly Medicare Part B premium, besides any premium the Medicare Advantage plan may charge.
How do I get Medicare?
Many people don’t have to do anything to get enrolled in Original Medicare. If you’re already receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board retirement benefits, you’re automatically enrolled when you turn 65. If you’re disabled, you’re automatically enrolled when you reach your 25th consecutive month of receiving disability benefits. You may also qualify for Medicare under the age of 65 if you have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
Once you’re enrolled in Original Medicare, you can decide to add to your coverage by enrolling in a Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan and/or a Medigap plan. Or, you might decide to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. There are different enrollment periods for these options.

Are outpatient psychiatric services covered by Medicare?
How much will Medicare pay for mental health and substance use services, and what out-of-pocket costs will beneficiaries be responsible for?
Is there information from Medicare.gov on mental health and substance abuse services?
For further information, follow one of the links below or scroll down the page.
While Medicare covers a broad array treatment services for those with mental illness and substance abuse disorders, special rules limit coverage and reimbursement. Medicare’s coverage of services for mental health, behavioral health and substance abuse disorders is not as extensive as its coverage for other services.
Treatment for Alcoholism and Substance Use Disorders
Medicare will pay for treatment of alcoholism and substance use disorders in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Medicare Part A pays for inpatient substance abuse treatment; individuals will pay the same co-pays as for any other type of inpatient hospitalization. Likewise, Medicare Part B will pay for outpatient substance abuse treatment services from a clinic or hospital outpatient department.
Covered items and services for the treatment of alcoholism and substance use disorders include:
- Psychotherapy
- Patient education regarding diagnosis and treatment
- Post-hospitalization follow-up
- Out-patient prescription drugs though Medicare Part D
- Inpatient prescription drugs including Methadone
- Structured Assessment and Brief Intervention (SBIRT)
SBRIT is an early intervention approach that targets individuals who have not yet reached the severity of a diagnostic level substance use disorder. SBRIT services are provided in outpatient settings, like a primary care physician’s office, or outpatient hospital department and are covered by Medicare when patients show early signs of drug abuse or dependency. This public health approach to treat substance abuse consists of three major components:
- Screening: Assessing a patient for risky substance use behaviors using standardized screening tools
- Brief Intervention: Engaging a patient showing risky substance use
- Referral to Treatment: Providing a referral to brief therapy or additional treatment to patients who need additional services.
Medicare likewise covers a new preventive benefit that offers screening and counseling for people who show signs of alcohol misuse but are not alcohol dependent and do not necessarily show signs of abuse.
Hospitalization
Medicare covers care in specialized psychiatric hospitals that only treat mental illness when in-patient care is needed for active psychiatric treatment. As with care in a general hospital, Medicare pays for necessary in-patient hospitalization for up to 90 days per benefit period. Medicare beneficiaries who need to be in a hospital for more than 90 days are entitled to 60 lifetime reserve days which can be used only once in a life time.
Unlike care in a general hospital, care in a specialized psychiatric hospital is limited to a total of 190 days in a lifetime. Once this maximum has been reached, Medicare coverage of psychiatric hospitalization is exhausted and cannot be renewed. This limitation can be harsh for individuals who need frequent and/or lengthy in-patient treatment in a specialized hospital. If they require lengthy hospitalizations for treatment of physical ailments, no such limitation would be placed on the number of covered hospitalizations to which they would be entitled.
It should be noted, the 190 day limit applies ONLY to treatment in specialty psychiatric hospitals. Individuals who require an in-patient level of care for the treatment of a psychiatric condition may receive such treatment at a general hospital and coverage rules follow that of general Part A hospital stay requirements.
Partial Hospitalization
Partial hospitalization programs offer intensive psychiatric treatment on an outpatient basis to psychiatric patients. For these patients, there is an expectation that their psychiatric condition and level of functioning will improve and thus prevent relapse and inpatient hospitalization. Partial hospitalization programs are located in hospital outpatient departments or community mental health centers. These programs include diagnostic services; individual and group therapy; therapeutic activities; family counseling regarding the patient’s condition; patient education; and the services of social workers, psychiatric nurses, and occupational therapists. Medicare does not cover transportation and meals provided to partial hospitalization patients, but, as discussed below, it does cover other partial hospitalization services.
Partial hospitalization services must be provided under the direct supervision of a physician pursuant to an individualized treatment plan, and the services must be essential for treatment of the patient’s condition. If the supervising physician “rides circuit” between the hospital and its outpatient services department, Medicare will sometimes deny claims on the grounds that no direct supervision is present. An individual must show that his or her treatment is under the direct, personal supervision of a physician, and that treatment is being provided in accordance with his or her individualized care plan. (Medicare Intermediary Manual § 3112.4.)
Clinician Coverage and Outpatient Mental Health Services
Medicare covers medically necessary diagnostic and treatment services provided by physicians, including psychiatrists, as well as clinical psychologists, social workers, psychiatric nurse specialists, nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants. Medicare does not cover treatment by licensed professional counselors. Clinicians must be enrolled in the Medicare program as a provider in order to bill and be reimbursed by Medicare.
Brief visits for the purpose of monitoring the efficacy of prescribed medications are Medicare-covered. Medicare also covers necessary outpatient mental health services including individual and group therapy, therapeutic activity programs, family counseling and patient education services, drugs that a patient generally cannot self-administer and diagnostic tests, including laboratory testing.
The Medicare statute itself places no limits on clinician coverage as long as the services provided are medically necessary. However, many Part B carriers have Local Medical Review Policies (LMRPs, also known as Local Coverage Determinations, or LCDs) setting out the number of visits Medicare will cover for mental health services. As a result of these policies, an individual may be told Medicare will not pay for doctor and other visits his or her providers consider to be medically necessary. The individual should appeal any denial of coverage that he or she believes is based on a LMRP rather than on his or her individual medical needs.
Home Health Services
Medicare pays for home health services for individuals who require skilled care on a part-time or intermittent basis and who are confined to the home. People with mental health needs who meet these eligibility criteria are eligible for care in their home, even if they have no physical limitations. An individual can be considered “homebound” if their illness is manifested in part by a refusal to leave the home or is of such a nature that it would not be safe for the individual to leave the home unattended. The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual highlights that home health psychological nursing would only be considered medically reasonable and necessary if the evidence demonstrates that the patient is a danger to self or others.[1] A home health record should document the need for home health psychiatric services and treatments. The record must also reflect the response of patients and caregivers to “any interventions provided.”[2]
Telehealth Services
Medicare pays for a limited number of Part B services furnished by a physician or practitioner to an eligible beneficiary via telehealth. This includes certain mental health services (e.g., individual psychotherapy and pharmacologic management, behavior assessment and intervention, psychiatric diagnostic interview exam, annual depression screening, psychoanalysis, family psychotherapy) as well as a number of specific behavioral health and substance abuse disorder services (e.g., smoking cessation services, alcohol and/or substance abuse structured assessment and intervention services, annual alcohol misuse screening, brief face-to-face behavioral counseling for alcohol misuse)
To be eligible for telehealth services, the originating site (location of the beneficiary) must be in a rural health professional shortage area (HPSA) located either outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or in a rural census tract; or a county outside of a MSA.[3]
Limitations on Reimbursement
Prior to 2010, reimbursement for certain psychiatric services differed from the usual Medicare reimbursement rules. .Pursuant to the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2009, beginning in 2010, Medicare began to increase the percentage that it will cover for mental health services. In 2014 and after Medicare will reimburse for mental health services at 80% of the approved rate, the same as for any other Part B claim.
Supplemental Insurance Coverage
Individuals should carefully consider their need for supplemental insurance coverage that will help pay for Medicare cost sharing and services that Medicare does not cover.
For Medicare beneficiaries with low income and assets, Medicaid can help pay for Medicare co-insurance and may “wrap-around” Medicare to provide mental health benefits Medicare does not. For more information on how Medicare works with Medicaid, see: http://cms.hhs.gov/Medicare-Medicaid-Coordination/Medicare-and-Medicaid-Coordination/Medicare-Medicaid-Coordination-Office/MedicareMedicaidGeneralInformation.html (site visited September 22, 2015)
Note: The Medicaid program requires that rural health clinics and federally qualified health center services include the services of a clinical psychologist and a clinical social worker. Coverage of other mental health services is not required. For more information on state coverage of mental health and substance use services, visit http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/rehabilitation-services-mental-health-and-substance-abuse/ (site visited September 22, 2015)
A Medigap plan can help beneficiaries afford costs associated with treatment for mental illness and substance use disorders. For more information on Medigap,see: https://www.medicareadvocacy.org/medicare-info/medigap/(site visited September 22, 2015).
Medicare Advantage and Special Needs Plans
While the majority of people with Medicare get their health coverage from Original Medicare, some people choose to get their benefits from a Medicare Advantage plan, sometimes called a Medicare private health plan.
Medicare Advantage plans contract with Medicare and are paid a fixed amount to provide Medicare benefits. They are generally managed care plans. The most common types are Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO), and Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS) plans. For more general information on Medicare Advantage, visit: https://www.medicareadvocacy.org/medicare-info/medicare-advantage/.
Medicare Advantage plans must cover the same services as Original Medicare described above. A Medicare Advantage plan requires individuals see an in-network mental health care provider. Medicare Advantage enrollees should contact their plan to find in-network providers for the treatment of mental illness, alcoholism and substance abuse.
There are specific Medicare Advantage plans created for people with chronic disease, including mental illness and/or chemical and substance abuse disorders. There is evidence that these Special Needs Plans for people with mental and behavioral health conditions perform well on quality measures and may provide an enhanced level of care. However, these plans do not exist all over the country and the quality of each individual plan will vary. To learn more about Special Needs Plans, visit: http://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11302.pdf (site visited September 23, 2015) or https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx (site visited September 23, 2015) to see if there are Special Needs Plans for mental illness in your area.
Returning to Work
Though some individuals are close to retirement and are considering health coverage options, some younger people with mental illness who are already on Medicare need to know their rights to continue Medicare if they return to work. These rights were expanded by the passage of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Pub. Law 106-170). Under this law, people who return to work, and therefore lose their Social Security disability benefits, can continue to receive Medicare coverage for 8½ years after returning to work. As with most other Medicare beneficiaries, they will not have to pay Part A premiums, but they will need to pay Part B premiums. At the end of the 8½ years a disabled worker may continue to receive Medicare by paying premiums under both Parts A and B.

Original Medicare is government-sponsored health insurance that includes Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance). It can be confusing to figure out which services Medicare covers, and which it doesn’t. Read more below to learn about the Medicare benefits you may be entitled to under Original Medicare.
Original Medicare — Part A
In general, Medicare Part A benefits include care you get as a hospital inpatient. For example:
- Skilled nursing services
- A semi-private room
- Meals
- Medications given to you as part of your inpatient treatment
- Hospital services and supplies
Medicare hospital coverage: If your enrolled in Medicare and your in the hospital, it's important to know whether you're considered an inpatient or an outpatient. This can affect how much you pay for your care. If your Medicare doctor has admitted you to a hospital as an inpatient, Medicare Part A coverage applies. It's possible to stay overnight at a hospital and still be an outpatient, in some cases (for example, if you're undergoing observation). If you haven't been admitted as an inpatient, Medicare Part B coverage usually applies.
Original Medicare — Part B
Medicare Part B covers many types of doctor visits and medical services. Please note that Medicare coverage applies only if certain conditions are met (for example, a service may have to be medically necessary and delivered in a Medicare-enrolled facility). Costs such as copayments and deductibles may apply. This is not a complete list.
- Preventive services, such as annual checkups (wellness) and vaccinations
- Durable medical equipment (DME)
- Mental health services
- Ambulance services
- Diabetic supplies
- Second opinion prior to surgery
Some services may be covered under Medicare Part A, Part B, or partially by both, depending on the situation. For example, cataract surgery may be outpatient surgery (covered by Part B) or inpatient surgery (covered by Part A).
About Medicare prescription drug coverage: Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) typically doesn't cover medications you take at home. Part A covers drugs you get as part of hospital inpatient care, and Part B covers certain drugs you may get as an outpatient - these are usually drugs that need to be administered to you at your doctor’s office. For most prescription drug coverage, you need to sign up for Medicare Part D. This optional coverage is available from private, Medicare-approved insurance companies.
What about Medicare coverage when you’re not yet 65, but you have a disability?
If you’re eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board disability benefits, you might qualify for Medicare. Learn more about Medicare and disability, including when your Medicare benefits may start.
Medicare Advantage (Medicare Part C)
There are some things Original Medicare doesn’t cover, such as routine dental or vision services, or prescription drugs in most situations. Many Medicare Advantage (Medicare Part C) plans do offer such benefits. Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private insurance companies approved by Medicare, and must include at least as much coverage as Medicare Part A and Part B (except hospice services, which Medicare Part A covers even if you have a Medicare Advantage plan). Costs and availability of Medicare Part C plans vary, but you continue paying your Medicare Part B premium when you’re enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.

Medicare is a health insurance program for:
- People age 65 or older.
- People under age 65 with certain disabilities.
- People of all ages with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant).
Medicare has different parts that help cover specific services:
Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) - Part A helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some home health care. Beneficiaries must meet certain conditions to get these benefits. Most people don't pay a premium for Part A because they or a spouse already paid for it through their payroll taxes while working.
Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) - Part B helps cover doctors' services and outpatient care. It also covers some other medical services that Part A doesn't cover, such as some of the services of physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care. Part B helps pay for these covered services and supplies when they are medically necessary. Most people pay a monthly premium for Part B.
Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage) - Medicare prescription drug coverage is available to everyone with Medicare. To get Medicare prescription drug coverage, people must join a plan approved by Medicare that offers Medicare drug coverage. Most people pay a monthly premium for Part D.

9,https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/CoverageGenInfo,"Medicare Coverage - General Information
Medicare provides coverage for items and services for over 55 million beneficiaries. The vast majority of coverage is provided on a local level and developed by clinicians at the contractors that pay Medicare claims. However, in certain cases, Medicare deems it appropriate to develop a National Coverage Determination (NCD) for an item or service to be applied on a national basis for all Medicare beneficiaries meeting the criteria for coverage. This page provides general information on various parts of that NCD process, resources of both a general and historical nature, and summaries and support documents concerning several miscellaneous NCDs.",Medcare Coverage,11
10,https://www.mymedicarematters.org/coverage/parts-a-b/whats-covered/,"What’s Covered by Original Medicare (Parts A and B)?
Medicare covers services (like lab tests, surgeries and doctor visits) and supplies (like wheelchairs and walkers) considered medically necessary to treat a disease or condition.
If you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan or other Medicare plan, you may have different rules, but your plan must give you at least the same coverage as Original Medicare. Some services may only be covered in certain settings or for patients with certain conditions.
Original Medicare covers many valuable services for people who are ill, recovering or in the final stages of their lives. These are services you might not need today, but preparing for what may happen 5, 10 or 20 years from now will give you peace of mind.
Explore some of your options if you sign up for Original Medicare.
Home health aides can help you bathe, use the toilet, take your drugs and do other daily activities. But Medicare only covers these services when you also need and get skilled nursing care or rehabilitative care. You can’t get more than 35 hours a week of nursing and home health aide care. Usually Medicare covers up to 28 hours a week of this kind of care.
Medicare offers a benefit for those nearing the end of life, called hospice care. This benefit is optional, so you must choose to receive this care. For you to qualify for hospice, a doctor must certify that you have 6 months or less to live. When you choose hospice care, you only waive your rights to Medicare benefits that would cover treatment of your terminal illness.
Medicare hospice benefits are covered if:
- You are eligible for Medicare Hospital Insurance (Part A), and
- Your doctor and the hospice medical director both certify that you areTerminally ill;Expected to die within 6 months; andYou choose hospice care and waive your right to other Medicare-covered benefits to treat your terminal illness, andYou get care from a hospice program that Medicare approves.
Talk with your medical team before you start to get any of these services. Make sure Medicare approves your hospice or you may have to pay the entire cost of these services.
Physical, speech-language and occupational therapy: You can get treatments to help you improve or maintain your ability to move, talk, swallow and do daily activities for as long as your doctor says you need them. These are called physical therapy and speech and language therapy services. If you get this kind of skilled therapy at home, you can also qualify for home health aide care.
Respite care is temporary care that lets the family member or friend who cares for your take time off to rest. You can stay in a setting Medicare approves for up to 5 days each time you get respite care. This may include a hospice inpatient facility, hospital or nursing home. And you can get respite care as many times as you need it.
A nurse can come to your home to treat your illness or injury. This is covered on a part-time basis. You can only get this care from a registered or licensed practical nurse. Medicare pays for a nurse to watch you and see if your condition changes. It also pays for a nurse to teach you and your caregivers how to take care of you.
What can I do if Medicare does not cover a service?
If Medicare decides not to cover your service, you have a right to know why. You should first speak to your provider and then with an advisor with Medicare. Regardless of the reason for the decision, you can appeal if you do not agree with Medicare.

What Is Medicare?
Medicare coverage is broken into four different parts. The different Medicare parts provide coverage for different types of health care services. When eligible individuals enroll in Medicare, they choose which Medicare parts they will participate in.
- Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) – Part A covers inpatient hospital stays, nursing facility care, hospice care and some home health care services.
- Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) – Part B covers certain doctors’ services, outpatient care, medical supplies, physician administered medicines and some preventive services.
- Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage Plans) – Part C is offered through private insurance companies.It provides all Part A and Part B benefits, and sometimes offers prescription drug coverage too. In addition to the Medicare A and B benefits, Medicare Advantage plans may offer extra coverage for other services not covered under traditional Medicare.
- Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Plan) – Part D offers prescription drug coverage through Medicare-approved private insurers.
You can learn more about Medicare coverage at www.medicare.gov.
Eligibility and Open Enrollment
You can only enroll in Medicare during certain pre-established times. Your initial enrollment period is determined based on when you become eligible for the program, which usually starts three months before the month you turn 65 and ends three months after the month you turn 65.
Regardless of when you enroll in Medicare, every year you can make changes to your coverage—including your Part D prescription drug coverage —during the open enrollment period. Open enrollment happens every year from October 15 to December 7. You can find more insights on open enrollment in our article “3 Tips for Choosing a Medicare Part D Plan.” To help you find the Part D plan that works best for you, it’s a good idea to have your list of prescription medicines in hand as you review your options. The Medicare Plan Finder tool can make shopping for a plan easier too.
Medicare Extra Help
Medicare offers Extra Help to qualifying low-income beneficiaries who participate in Medicare Part D. This Extra Help gives eligible applicants additional assistance, such as help with premiums and out-of-pocket costs. You can learn more about what it covers and eligibility on the Medicare Extra Help with Prescription Drug Plan Costs website.

12,https://www.healthcare.gov/medicare/medicare-and-the-marketplace/,"Medicare isn’t part of the Health Insurance Marketplace, so if you have Medicare coverage now you don’t need to do anything.
The Marketplace won’t affect your Medicare choices or benefits. No matter how you get Medicare, whether through Original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO), you won’t have to make any changes.
IMPORTANTThe Marketplace doesn’t offer Medicare supplement (Medigap) insurance or Part D drug plans.
IMPORTANTThe Marketplace doesn’t offer Medicare supplement (Medigap) insurance or Part D drug plans.
If you have Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance), you’re considered covered under the health care law and don’t need a Marketplace plan.
But having only Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) doesn’t meet this requirement.
TIPIf you have only Medicare Part B, you aren't considered to have qualifying health coverage. This means you may have to pay the fee for the 2018 plan year and earlier. Starting with the 2019 plan year (for which you’ll file taxes in April 2020), the fee no longer applies.

Learn about your options if you’re retired but don’t have Medicare coverage.
Generally, no. It’s against the law for someone who knows you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.
If you’re getting Social Security retirement or disability benefits before you’re eligible for Medicare, you’ll automatically be enrolled in Medicare once you’re eligible.
Learn more about Medicare enrollment rules.
No. It’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell or issue you a Marketplace policy. This is true even if you have only Medicare Part A or only Part B.
Yes. You can get a Marketplace plan to cover you before your Medicare begins. You can then cancel the Marketplace plan once your Medicare coverage starts.
In most cases, no. If the Marketplace in your state is run by the federal government, you won’t be able buy a stand-alone dental plan unless you’re also buying a health plan. If your state is running its own Marketplace, you may be able to purchase a stand-alone dental plan.
While prescription drug coverage is an essential health benefit, prescription drug coverage in a Marketplace or SHOP health plan isn’t required to be at least as good as (creditable) Medicare Part D coverage.
Yes. You can delay Part B enrollment if you’re getting health coverage through the SHOP Marketplace based on your or your spouse’s job.
If you don’t sign up during this special enrollment period:
Yes. Coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace is treated the same as coverage from any job-based health plan. If you’re getting health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace based on your or your spouse’s current job, Medicare Secondary Payer rules apply.

13,https://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2011/medicare-coverage.html,"What Does Medicare Cover?
Four Parts: A, B, C and D
En español | Unlike other health insurance, Medicare coverage is divided into four parts: A, B, C and D. This allows you to choose which parts you want and avoid duplicating coverage from other insurance.
Part A helps pay the costs of a stay in a hospital or skilled nursing facility, home health care, hospice care, and medicines administered to inpatients.
Part B helps pay bills for physicians and outpatient services such as rehab therapy, lab tests and medical equipment. It also covers doctors' services in the hospital and most medicines administered in a doctor's office.
Part C is a different way you can choose to receive your Medicare benefits. It consists of a variety of private health plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans (mainly HMOs and PPOs) that cover Part A, Part B and (often) Part D services in one package. (See ""Figuring Out Your Choices."")
Part D helps pay the cost of prescription drugs that you use at home, plus insulin supplies and some vaccines. To get this coverage, you must enroll in a private Part D drug plan or in a Medicare Advantage plan that includes Part D drugs. (See""Figuring Out Your Choices."")
Medicare covers most services deemed ""medically necessary,"" but it doesn't cover everything. Except in limited circumstances, it doesn't cover routine vision, hearing and dental care; nursing home care; or medical services outside the United States.
Exams and checkups: Medicare doesn’t cover routine physical exams. But when you’re new to Medicare, you’re entitled to a one-time “Welcome to Medicare” exam and medical history review within 12 months of enrolling in Part B. Also, Medicare offers annual wellness checkups. Both are free of charge if provided by a doctor who accepts Medicare reimbursement in full.
Early detection: Certain lab tests and screenings used to diagnose diseases early are also free of charge. These include mammograms, pap smears, bone density measurement, and screenings for cardiovascular disease, prostate cancer, HIV and diabetes. Although the tests themselves are free, in most cases you still pay the required copay to see the doctor who prescribes them.
For more coverage information, see the ""Medicare & You"" handbook (PDF).
Going to the Doctor
Most doctors accept Medicare patients, but some don't. Be aware that a physician who has opted out of Medicare cannot bill Medicare for treating you, and you will be responsible for the whole cost. It’s also important to find out whether a doctor accepts Medicare “assignment,” which means that he or she has agreed to the Medicare-approved amount as payment in full, or whether the doctor can charge you up to 15 percent above this amount. (See related article “Seeing a Doctor 'on Assignment.'"")
If you need to find a primary care doctor or specialist who accepts Medicare, go to the physician database on Medicare's website or call Medicare at 1-800-633-4227.
Note that the above information applies if you’re in the traditional Medicare program. if you enroll in a Medicare Advantage HMO, you must generally go to doctors who are in the plan’s provider network and service area. Medicare Advantage PPOs also have provider networks but allow you to go out of network for higher copays.

*Plan F has an option called a high deductible Plan F. This option is not currently offered by UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company. This high deductible plan pays the same benefits as Plan F after you have paid a calendar year deductible of $2,340 in 2020. Benefits from high deductible Plan F will not begin until out-of-pocket expenses exceed $2,340 in 2020. Out-of-pocket expenses for this deductible are expenses that would ordinarily be paid by the policy. These expenses include the Medicare deductibles for Part A and Part B, but do not include the plan's separate foreign travel emergency deductible.
**NY: In New York, the Excess Charge is limited to 5%; PA and OH: Under Pennsylvania and Ohio law, a physician may not charge or collect fees from Medicare patients which exceed the Medicare-approved Part B charge. Plans F and G pay benefits for excess charges when services are rendered in a jurisdiction not having a balance billing law; TX: In Texas, the amount cannot exceed 15% over the Medicare approved amount or any other charge limitation established by the Medicare program or state law. Note that the limiting charge applies only to certain services and does not apply to some supplies and durable medical equipment; VT: Vermont law generally prohibits a physician from charging more than the Medicare approved amount. However, there are exceptions and this prohibition may not apply if you receive services out of state.
†Care needed immediately because of an injury or an illness of sudden and unexpected onset. Benefit is 80% and beneficiaries are responsible for 20% after the $250 annual deductible with a $50,000 lifetime maximum for medically necessary emergency care received outside the U.S. during the first 60 days of each trip.
1For Plans K and L, after you meet your out-of-pocket yearly limit and your yearly Part B deductible, the plan pays 100% of covered services for the rest of the calendar year.
2Plan N pays 100% of the Part B coinsurance, except for a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to a $50 copayment for emergency room visits that don’t result in an inpatient admission.
Benefits and costs vary depending on the Plan chosen.

*Plans F and G also have a high deductible option which requires first paying a plan deductible of $2340 before the plan begins to pay. Once the deductible is met, the plan pays 100% of covered services for the rest of the calendar year. High deductible plan G does not cover the Medicare Part B deductible.

Do you have fairly frequent doctor or hospital visits? If so, you may already know that Medicare Part A and Part B come with out-of-pocket costs you have to pay. You might be able to save money with a Medicare Supplement insurance plan. Medicare Supplement, or Medigap, insurance plans fill in “gaps” in basic benefits left behind by Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.
In 47 states, there are up to 10 standardized Medicare Supplement insurance plans that are denoted by the letters A through N (plans E, H, I, and J are no longer sold). The private insurance companies offering these plans do not have to offer every Medicare Supplement plan, but they must offer at least Plan A.
Please note that although the names may sound similar, the “parts” of Medicare, such as Part A and Part B, are not the same as Medigap Plan A, Plan B, etc.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan basic benefits
Each Medicare Supplement insurance plan offers a different level of basic benefits, but each lettered plan must include the same standardized basic benefits regardless of insurance company and location. For example, Medicare Supplement Plan G in Florida includes the same basic benefits as Plan G in North Dakota. Please note that if you live in Massachusetts, Minnesota, or Wisconsin, your Medicare Supplement insurance plan options are different than in the rest of the country. Medicare Supplement insurance plans do not have to cover vision, dental, long-term care, or hearing aids, but all plans must cover at least a portion of the following basic benefits:
- Medicare Part A coinsurance costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are exhausted
- Medicare Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayments
- Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayments
- First three pints of blood used in a medical procedure
Some plans include additional basic benefits. For example, Medicare Supplement Plan F*, the most comprehensive standardized Medigap insurance plan, carries the following additional benefits:
- Medicare Part A deductible
- Medicare Part B deductible*
- Part B excess charges
- Part B preventive care coinsurance
- Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) care coinsurance
- Foreign travel emergency care (80% of Medicare-approved costs, up to plan limits)
Some plans may include additional innovative benefits.
*Medicare Supplement plans that may cover the Medicare Part B deductible – Medicare Supplement Plans C and F – will be phased out. If you’re not eligible for Medicare until January 1, 2020 or later, you won’t be able to buy Plan C or Plan F. You won’t generally have to give up your Plan C or Plan F if you already have one. If you’re eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, you might be able to buy Plan C or Plan F.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan costs
Although private insurance companies are required to offer the same basic benefits for each lettered plan, they do have the ability to charge different premiums. You might want to shop around to find a Medicare Supplement insurance plan that may fit your medical and financial needs. Insurance companies may price their plan premiums in any of the following ways:
- Community no-age-rated: These Medicare Supplement insurance plans charge premiums that are the same across the board, regardless of age.
- Issue-age-rated: These plans base their premiums on your age when you first enrolled in the policy. Therefore, the younger you are when you enroll in this type of plan, the lower your premium will be.
- Attained-age-rated: Like issue-age-rated, these plans base their premiums on the age you were when you first bought a policy, but unlike issue-age-rated, premiums increase as you get older.
Please note that no matter what rating method an insurance company uses, premiums may increase over time for reasons other than age, such as inflation.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan enrollment and eligibility
To be eligible to enroll in a Medicare Supplement insurance plan, you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B. A good time to enroll in a plan is generally during the Medigap Open Enrollment Period, which begins on the first day of the month that you are both age 65 or older and enrolled in Part B, and lasts for six months. During this period, you have a guaranteed-issue right to join any Medicare Supplement insurance plan available where you live. You may not be denied basic benefits based on any pre-existing conditions** during this enrollment period (although a waiting period may apply). If you miss this enrollment period and attempt to enroll in the future, you may be denied basic benefits or charged a higher premium based on your medical history. In some states, you may be able to enroll in a Medigap plan before the age of 65.
**Pre-existing conditions are generally health conditions that existed before the start of a policy. They may limit coverage, be excluded from coverage, or even prevent you from being approved for a policy; however, the exact definition and relevant limitations or exclusions of coverage will vary with each plan, so check a specific plan’s official plan documents to understand how that plan handles pre-existing conditions

Medicare Supplement (also known as Medigap or MedSupp) insurance plans help cover certain out-of-pocket costs that Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, doesn’t cover. There are 10 plan types available in most states, and each plan is labeled with a different letter that corresponds with a certain level of basic benefits.
In most states, Medigap insurance plans have the same standardized benefits for each letter category. This means that the basic benefits for a Plan A, for example, is the same across every insurance company that sells Plan A, regardless of location. This makes it easy to compare Medicare Supplement insurance plans because the main difference between plans of the same letter category will be the premium cost.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin standardize their Medicare Supplement insurance plans differently from the rest of the country. In all states, insurance companies that sell Medicare Supplement insurance aren’t required to offer all plan types. However, any insurance company that sells Medigap insurance is required by law to offer Medigap Plan A. If an insurance company wants to offer other Medigap plans, it must sell either Plan C or Plan F in addition to any other plans it would like to sell.
The chart below allows you to compare Medicare Supplement insurance plans based on what’s offered across the standardized plans that are available in most states.
* There is also a high-deductible version of Plan F where beneficiaries pay a deductible of $2,300 in 2019 before the Medigap plan begins to cover Medicare-covered costs.
An important note about Medicare Supplement Plans F and C: You may not be able to buy these plans if you qualify for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. That includes high-deductible Plan F. If you already have one of these plans, you won’t have to give it up.
You might be able to get a high-deductible Medicare Supplement Plan G in 2020, according to America’s Health Insurance Plans (ahip.org). It doesn’t pay for the Medicare Part B deductible.
** After the out-of-pocket limit (including the Medicare Part B deductible) is reached for Plans K or L, the Medigap plan pays 100% of Medicare-covered services for the remainder of the calendar year.
***Plan N pays 100% of the Medicare Part B coinsurance costs, with the exception of a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to $50 for emergency room visits that don’t result in the beneficiary being admitted as an inpatient.
****Medically Necessary Emergency Care in a Foreign Country: coverage to the extent not covered by Medicare for 80 percent of the billed charges for Medicare-eligible expenses for medically necessary emergency hospital, physician and medical care received in a foreign country, which care would have been covered by Medicare if provided in the United States and which care began during the first 60 consecutive days of each trip outside the United States, subject to a calendar year deductible of $250, and a lifetime maximum benefit of $50,000. For purposes of this benefit, “emergency care” shall mean care needed immediately because of an injury or an illness of sudden and unexpected onset.

- The CARES Act of 2020
Anyone who's ready to sign up for Medicare has a lot of decisions to make. But one decision is especially important: Should you choose Medicare Advantage or use Medigap to supplement your Original Medicare plan?
Key Takeaways
- Traditional Medicare provides good basic health coverage, but it pays only about 80% of approved costs for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures and usually doesn't cover prescription drug costs or such things as routine dental care.
- Medigap supplemental insurance plans are designed to fill Medicare Part A and Part B coverage gaps.
- To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance) within the seven-month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
- You can choose to get your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits through a Medicare Advantage plan. They often include benefits beyond Part A and Part B. Private, Medicare-approved health insurance companies offer these plans.
- Although Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is optional, if you don’t get it as either as a stand-alone plan or as part of a Medicare Advantage plan, there may be financial penalties if you need to buy a policy later on because you need expensive drugs.
- Consider plan costs, plan doctors, convenience, your lifestyle and travel plans, your health, and any additional benefits in making your Medicare coverage choices.
Medicare Coverage
Budgeting for healthcare costs in retirement is tough since there’s usually no way of knowing whether your expenses each year will be minimal or huge. While traditional Medicare (Part A and Part B) provides good basic coverage, it pays only about 80% of the costs it approves for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. The other 20% of the bill is the individual’s responsibility and—unlike coverage under the Affordable Care Act—there is no cap on the amount a person might have to pay in one year.
Let's say, for example, that you need heart bypass surgery. The cost would be a minimum of $85,891, according to the American Heart Association , and you would be responsible for a co-pay of $17,178—or much more if there are complications or something else goes wrong. In addition, some health needs, such as prescription drugs, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and dental care, are not covered at all by regular Medicare (Part A and Part B).
There are two basic ways for recipients to fill most of these coverage gaps and reduce the risk of tremendous bills in a bad health year:
Medicare Plus Medigap Supplemental Insurance Policies
About two-thirds of the 61 million seniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries choose traditional Medicare, Parts A and B, which cover hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. About 80% of these beneficiaries supplement their insurance with Medigap (Medicare Supplement) insurance, Medicaid, employer-sponsored insurance, and/or stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies.
Medicare Supplement insurance plans are not connected with or endorsed by the U.S. government or the federal Medicare program.
While this may be the more expensive option, it has a few advantages. Both Medicare and Medigap insurance plans cover you for any hospital or doctor in the U.S. that accepts Medicare, and the great majority do. There is no need for prior authorization or a referral from a primary care doctor. Coverage includes the entire U.S., which may be important for those who travel frequently or spend part of the year in a different locale. This option is also attractive to those who have particular physicians and hospitals they want to use.
Medicare Advantage Plans
Available from private, Medicare-approved insurance companies, Medicare Advantage policies (Part C) are marketed to consumers under such names as Aetna, Humana, and Kaiser Foundation Medicare plans. They may have no premium or a lower one compared to the significant premiums for Medigap and prescription drug insurance policies. Medicare Advantage plans cover hospitals and doctors and often also include prescription drug coverage and some services not covered by Medicare. A little more than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries choose one of these plans.
Most Medicare Advantage plans operate as health maintenance organization (HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO) insurance. HMOs limit members to using the doctors and hospitals in their networks. PPOs generally let members get care outside the plan's network, but members may have to pay more for such care. Some plans require prior authorization for specialist care or procedures, and/or a referral from a primary care doctor. Plans might not cover care given outside of the network’s geographical area. Extra benefits not covered by regular Medicare, such as eyeglasses, routine dental care, or gym memberships, may be offered.
When to Sign Up for Medicare
As you approach age 65, it’s important to know which enrollment deadlines apply to your circumstances to avoid costly fines and gaps in coverage. Begin by checking on your eligibility. To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospitals) and Part B (doctors) in the seven month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
If you currently get Social Security, you will be automatically enrolled; if not, you need to sign up either online or at your Social Security office.
Medicare Part B
If you are working at age 65, however, and you have employer insurance through a company with more than 20 employees, you have the right to stay on your employer insurance and delay signing up for Medicare Part B until your employer coverage ends. If you work for an employer with fewer than 20 employees, it is very important to ask the employer whether you are required to sign up for Medicare and get that decision in writing.
Medicare Part D
You need to be signed up for Medicare Parts A and B before you can enroll in a Medicare Advantage (Part C) plan. Once you’ve enrolled in Medicare, a key decision point is choosing coverage for Part D prescription drug insurance. If you don’t enroll in Part D insurance when you start Medicare and want to buy drug coverage later on, you may be permanently penalized for signing up late.
You can avoid the penalty, however, if you have what's known as creditable prescription drug coverage, which is prescription drug coverage (from an employer or union, for example) that’s expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. If you have this kind of drug coverage when you become eligible for Medicare, you are generally allowed to keep it. You generally won't have to pay a penalty if you later decide to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and you haven't gone for longer than 63 continuous days without creditable coverage.
Many Medicare Advantage plans include Part D drug insurance, but a stand-alone policy can also be purchased for those who choose regular Medicare (Part A and Part B) or a Medicare Advantage plan that doesn’t include Part D.
Choosing Traditional Medicare Plus a Medigap Plan
Regular or traditional Medicare comprises Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance). You can supplement this coverage with a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and a Medigap supplemental insurance plan. While signing up for Medicare gets you into Parts A and B, you have to take action on your own to buy these supplemental policies.
Finding Part D, Drug Insurance
To get started, find the plans available in your zip code. Once you have created an account at Medicare.gov, you can enter the names of your drugs and use a convenient tool that allows you to compare plan premiums, deductibles, and Medicare star ratings.
If you don’t take many (or any) prescription drugs, look for a plan with a low monthly premium. All plans must still cover most drugs used by people with Medicare. If, on the other hand, you have high prescription drug costs, check into plans that cover your drugs in the donut hole, the coverage gap period that kicks in after you and the plan have spent $4,020 on covered drugs in 2020.
Selecting a Medigap (supplemental) Plan: Recent Changes Limit Choices
Medigap policies are private plans, available from insurance companies or through brokers, but not on medicare.gov. They are labeled Plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, each with a different standardized coverage set. Some plans include emergency medical benefits during foreign travel. Since coverage is standard, there are no ratings of Medigap policies. Consumers can confidently compare insurer’s prices for each letter plan and simply choose the better deal.
As of Jan. 1, 2020, Medigap plans sold to new Medicare beneficiaries aren't allowed to cover the Part B deductible.
Until recently, most people (66%) who bought Medigap policies chose Plan F, which gave the most comprehensive coverage, including paying for the Medicare Part B deductible ($198 in 2020).12 However, in an effort to trim Medicare expenses, Congress suspended Plans C and F for people who become Medicare-eligible in 2020 and beyond.
Plan D and Plan G have similar benefits to Plan C and Plan F, except for not covering the Part B deductible. People who signed up or became eligible for Medicare before 2020 can purchase or continue Plans C or F, though prices may rise and it may be a better deal to switch to a plan that doesn’t cover the deductible.
Choosing a Medicare Advantage Plan
Medicare Advantage Health Plans are similar to private health insurance. Most services, such as office visits, lab work, surgery, and many others, are covered after a small co-pay. Plans might offer an HMO or PPO network and all plans place a yearly limit on total out-of-pocket expenses. Each plan has different benefits and rules. Most provide prescription drug coverage. Some require a referral to see a specialist while others won’t. Some may pay a portion of out-of-network care, while others will cover only doctors and facilities that are in the HMO or PPO network. There are also other types of Medicare Advantage plans.
Selecting a plan with a low or no annual premium can be important. But its also essential to check on co-pay and coinsurance costs, especially for expensive hospital stays and procedures, to estimate your possible annual expenses. Since care is often limited to in-network physicians and hospitals, the quality and size of a particular plan’s network should be an important factor in your choice.
Head to the Find a Medicare plan page at medicare.gov where the compare feature allows you to look at plans side by side. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), an insurance rating organization, also compares what consumers think of Medicare Advantage plan’s services and physicians, and whether the plans meet certain quality standards. Top ratings in 2019 were garnered by an impressive 43 Aetna Medicare Advantage plans sold in 37 states plus the District of Columbia. Other companies with highly-rated Medicare Advantage plans included: Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Humana, Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, and United Healthcare. Be sure to check the ratings for plans available in your state.
What to Consider in Making Your Choice
Your lifestyle, health condition, and finances may all influence whether traditional Medicare plus Medigap or Medicare Advantage is best for you. Here are some things to consider:
The Costs
Medicare Advantage plans might save you money, but be sure to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll need to buy a separate Part D plan if you want that coverage. Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and whether there are any limits in their coverage. If extra benefits are included, such as help with hearing aids and dental bills, be sure to find out how much of these expenses will actually be covered.
Compare these costs to those of purchasing Medigap and stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies. Calculate the premiums, as well as the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance) the policies may require. Yes, these can be complex calculations, but an insurance broker can help by doing the math for you and making cost-saving recommendations.
Choice of Doctors
Traditional Medicare allows you to use any U.S. doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare, and most do. Most Medicare Advantage plans restrict you to using physicians in their network and may cover less, or none, of the expenses of using out-of-network and out-of-town providers.
A plus of Medicare Advantage managed care plans is that care is coordinated and your primary care doctor will be in the loop about the findings of specialists. With traditional Medicare you don’t need a referral to see a specialist or a prior authorization for procedures, but you’ll need to make sure care is coordinated and your doctors are in communication with one another. Often this is best done by developing a relationship with a primary care physician and letting them refer you to specialists.
Local Conditions and Convenience
In some areas where physicians and hospitals are scarce, it’s important to check out both the networks of available Medicare Advantage plans and the locations of providers who accept regular Medicare. Are the doctors accepting new patients? Will you have to travel far to see a provider or be treated at an emergency room? Advice from local professionals, neighbors, and licensed insurance brokers can help you find Medicare Advantage plans that do business in your area. Compare plans to find one that may suit your needs.
Lifestyle Factors
Frequent travel, dual residences, and currently having physicians whom you would like to keep are some of the factors that may make regular Medicare a good choice. Ask your current physicians if they participate in any Medicare Advantage plans and/or accept regular Medicare. For frequent fliers, choosing regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance policy that covers emergency care in foreign countries may be a good bet. Similarly, people who spend part of the year in a different geographical area may find it difficult to stay in network for medical care and might be better off with regular Medicare and a Medigap insurance policy.
Your Health
People with chronic diseases and those who develop a serious health condition should look deeper into the choices available. A Medicare Advantage plan may be a better choice if it has an out-of-pocket maximum that protects you from huge bills. Regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance plan generally allows you more choice in where you receive your care. Check whether any expensive drugs or equipment (such as supplies for people with diabetes) will be covered by your Medicare prescription drug plan, whether it's a stand-alone one or part of a Medicare Advantage plan.
Broader Benefits
Medicare Advantage plans are in the throes of change as the government allows insurers to add coverage for items that are not included in regular Medicare. These include such things as supplying food for service animals; paying for ramps for wheelchairs, hold bars, and indoor air quality monitors; adult day care; and residential and in-home respite care. Many of these benefits are just being initiated, so it pays to reconsider your choice of regular Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage each year during open enrollment to make sure you’re getting the benefits you need most, whether it's home care or transportation to doctors.
Can You Switch? Yes, But There’s a Catch
It’s logical to consider enjoying the cost savings of a Medicare Advantage plan while you’re relatively healthy, and then switching back to regular Medicare if you develop a condition you want treated at an out-of-town facility. In fact, switching between the two forms of Medicare (or between Medicare Advantage plans) is an option for everyone during the open enrollment period in the fall. This Annual Election Period runs from October 15 - December 7 each year.
Here’s the catch. If you switch back to regular Medicare (Part A and Part B), you may not be able to sign up for a Medigap insurance policy. When you first sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B, Medigap insurance companies are generally obligated to sell you a policy, regardless of your medical condition. But in subsequent years they may have the right to charge you extra due to your age and preexisting conditions, or not to sell you a policy at all if you have serious medical problems. Some states have enacted laws to address this. In New York and Connecticut, for example, Medigap insurance plans are guaranteed-issue year-round, while California, Massachusetts, Maine, Missouri, and Oregon have all set aside annual periods in which switching is allowed. If you live in a state that doesn't have this protection, planning to switch between the systems depending on your health condition is a risky business.
The CARES Act of 2020
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package, called the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act, into law. It expands Medicare's ability to cover treatment and services for those affected by COVID-19. The CARES Act also:
- Increases flexibility for Medicare to cover telehealth services.
- Authorizes Medicare certification for home health services by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse specialists.
- Increases Medicare payments for COVID-19-related hospital stays and durable medical equipment.
For Medicaid, the CARES Act clarifies that non-expansion states can use the Medicaid program to cover COVID-19-related services for uninsured adults who would have qualified for Medicaid if the state had chosen to expand. Other populations with limited Medicaid coverage are also eligible for coverage under this state option.",Medicare Supplement Insurance,7

- The differences will be in the price and who administers the plan.
- Each insurer may not offer all types of Medicare Supplement plans in your area.
- Choose a health insurer you trust, and shop around for the best prices.

How do I get a Medicare Supplement plan?
You can buy a Medicare Supplement insurance plan only if you already have Original Medicare, Part A and Part B. You can buy Medicare Supplement plans from private insurance companies.

Compare Medicare Supplement Plans
When can I get a Medicare Supplement plan?
Your Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period (OEP) begins the first day of the month in which you are at least 65 and covered under Medicare Part B. You have six months to buy a Medicare Supplement insurance plan when the company is required to sell it to you. If you wait until after your OEP, you can apply anytime you want, but a plan could reject you or charge you more if you have health problems.
There may be other times after your OEP when you have “guaranteed-issue rights” to a Medicare Supplement plan.
For example, say you sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan. (Medicare Supplement plans don’t work with Medicare Advantage plans.)
- Suppose you decide to drop the Medicare Advantage plan and return to Original Medicare.
- Suppose it has been a year or less since you signed up for the Medicare Advantage plan.
- You have a right to buy a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan.
- Your “guaranteed issue rights” to a Medigap plan only apply to certain plans.
Medicare Supplement coverage of pre-existing conditions
Medicare Part A and Part B typically cover pre-existing conditions. The same goes for Medicare Supplement insurance. The difference is, a company may be able to refuse to sell you a Medicare Supplement plan in the first place in some cases.
As long as you buy a Medicare Supplement plan during the six-month Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period, the insurance company cannot refuse to sell you a plan. The insurance company also can’t charge you more because you have health problems or make you wait for basic benefits to begin.
However, you may have to wait up to six months for the Medicare Supplement policy’s benefits to include your pre-existing condition*.
If you apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan outside of your Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period, the private insurance company may “underwrite” the plan.
Underwriting the plan means that you may be subject to a physical exam, and the insurance company can refuse to sell you the plan or they can adjust your premium based on your health status.
Shop Medicare Supplement Insurance Plans
How insurance companies set Medigap premiums
There are three ways that an insurance company can set Medigap premium rates for Medicare Supplement plans:
- “Community-rated” (or “no-age-rated”) premiums are the same for everyone, regardless of age.
- “Issue-age-rated” (or “entry-age-rated”) premiums are based on your age when you first buy the policy. The sooner you buy, the less you will pay.
- “Attained-age-rated” premiums are based on your current age, meaning it goes up as you grow older.
Other factors impacting the premium rates of Medicare Supplement plans can include inflation, geography, medical underwriting (if you did not buy a plan when first eligible), and other discounts.
You should check with each specific health insurer to see how it sets Medigap prices before you buy.
*Pre-existing conditions are generally health conditions that existed before the start of a policy. They may limit coverage, be excluded from coverage, or even prevent you from being approved for a policy; however, the exact definition and relevant limitations or exclusions of coverage will vary with each plan, so check a specific plan’s official plan documents to understand how that plan handles pre-existing conditions.

Medicare is an extremely valuable healthcare resource for many seniors. However, Medicare alone does not cover all of the healthcare costs one is likely to face later in life. And since unexpected medical expenses can lead to stress and financial strain, many seniors prefer to be prepared for what might lay ahead.
Medicare Supplement Insurance is one way seniors can plan ahead for these unexpected costs. Customers pay a monthly premium for insurance that lowers or totally covers the out of pocket costs for expenses such as deductibles, copays, hospital stays, and doctor’s appointments. Some plans offer more extensive benefits for expenses such as international healthcare and skilled nursing facilities. There are numerous different plans available to accommodate people who desire different levels of coverage. And while having so many options makes it easy to get the right level of coverage, it can be overwhelming to sort through all of the companies that offer Medicare Supplement plans to find the right one for you.
To help make this decision easier, we’ve created a guide that profiles the best Medicare Supplement companies across the United States. You’ll find details about available plans, pricing models, customer service practices, and additional benefits. As you shop, this guide will help you understand which policies are best for you and help you narrow down your options. If you aren’t sure that Medicare Supplement Insurance is something you need, see our buyer’s guide at the bottom of the page for more insight.
Since it’s a type of insurance, descriptions of Medicare Supplement policies often contain terminology and stipulations that can be confusing to many shoppers. We’ve included this section to help you understand exactly what each plan and company is offering.
Eligibility: Medicare Supplement Insurance can only be purchased by people who are covered by Original Medicare: Parts A and B. Seniors with Part C, or Medicare Advantage, can not purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Insurance is Private: While Medicare is a federal program, it’s important to realize that Medicare Supplement policies are provided to consumers by private insurance companies and not the government. However, both the federal and state governments regulate the plans that are offered. Each insurance company has the ability to decide which plans it wants to offer.
Standardized Plans: All of the plans available are standardized and will offer the same basic benefits, but some companies may offer extra benefits in addition to what is required. Currently, the available plans include A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N. So while factors like the cost of a plan may vary, Plan A from one company must cover the exact same things as Plan A from any other company. Only Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have standardized plans differing from the rest of the country.
Due to new regulations, Plans C and F will not be offered to new Medicare enrollees after January 2020. However, anyone who already has Plans C or F will be able to keep their coverage, and anyone who was eligible for Medicare before January 2020 may still be able to choose Plan C or F.
Medigap: As you shop for Medicare Supplement plans, you’ll likely see companies use the term “Medigap.” Medigap is simply another popular term for Medicare Supplement Insurance. Some websites may also use the abbreviation MSI.
Plan Types: Some plans are available in high-deductible, select, and innovative options. The government does not require companies to offer these options.
Prescription Medications: Medicare Supplement plans do not cover prescription medication. However, customers who want this coverage can add on Medicare Part D, which is offered by many companies who provide Medicare Supplement plans.
Pricing Structures: When shopping for Medicare Supplement Insurance, you’ll likely encounter three different pricing structures that affect how much your policy costs. The pricing structure that is used will be determined by the company issuing the policy as well as state laws. These pricing structures are:
The world of insurance is large and there are hundreds of companies across the country offering Medicare Supplement plans. So to narrow it down and choose the best companies in the industry, we took the following factors into consideration:
Variety of Plans Offered

Number of States Served
There are many insurance companies around the country that only offer Medicare Supplement Insurance in a handful of states. While it’s difficult to find true nationwide coverage, the companies featured on our list are able to serve a majority of the country. However, not all plans will be offered in all places.
Company Integrity
When purchasing something as important as health insurance, it’s vital to select a provider you can trust. Because of this, we focused our search on companies that are widely regarded as trustworthy and have a long history of providing customers with insurance services. To determine this, we looked at factors like awards won, Better Business Bureau ratings, and customer reviews.

The insurance may be provided by any one of a number of Cigna family companies, such as American Retirement Life Insurance, depending on the customer’s location. Customers are able to research and purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance directly on Cigna’s website, but can also reach an agent over the phone to discuss plans.
Cigna’s Medicare Supplement plans do not require customers to use an in-network doctor, so seniors are free to use any healthcare provider who accepts Medicare.

Most Experience Working with Seniors
AARP is a special interest group that has served seniors since 1958. The company was founded with the goal of keeping aging Americans informed, empowered, and independent. Through various programs and services, it works to make the world more accessible and enjoyable for seniors across the country.
AARP is not an insurance company itself, but it does frequently team up with insurance providers to bring seniors affordable and accessible insurance solutions. To provide Medicare Supplement plans, it has teamed up with United Healthcare, an experienced nationwide health insurance company.
Coverage
AARP offers plans A, B, C, F, G, K, L, and N. Plans are available in all 50 states, but the plans that are available will vary by location. Customers only need to enter their zip code to see an estimate for a Medicare Supplement plan with AARP. The website will then display all of the plans available in your area. The premium estimates displayed assume that you are turning 65 and do not use tobacco products, so your actual premium may vary depending on your age and habits. Alternatively, customers can contact an agent to discuss their options over the phone.
Customers will also have the option to purchase Medicare Part D directly through United Healthcare when they sign up for a Medicare Supplement plan if they wish to have coverage for prescription medications.
To qualify for coverage, you must be an AARP member, which comes with an annual fee of $16. The company makes it easy for customers to join AARP at the same time they sign up for Medicare Supplement Insurance. Membership includes access to a lot of extra benefits such as discounted movie tickets, car rentals, hotels, and more.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
AARP generally uses community-rated pricing, which means that a 66-year-old woman in a given area would pay the same amount as a 76-year-old living in the same area. However, since most seniors will get a discount when they enroll at age 65 and the discount decreases every following year, the pricing model ends up being similar to age-attained.

Best for Medicare Experience
Mutual of Omaha has been offering Medicare Supplement Insurance since Medicare’s inception in 1966, making it one of the most experienced companies when it comes to navigating the Medicare system. The company has a great reputation for offering quality health insurance products across the country.
Owned by its policyholders, Mutual of Omaha also has a reputation for being a company that cares about its customers. The company values excellent service, stating that 98% of all Medicare claims are paid out within 12 hours. The genuine concern for the well-being of its customers combined with its long experience with Medicare makes Mutual of Omaha an excellent choice for Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Coverage
Mutual of Omaha offers plans A, F, HD-F, G, and N. Coverage is available nationwide, although not all plans will be available in all states. It also offers Medicare Part D, making it easy for customers to get coverage for prescription drugs as well. The company has several subsidiary companies, so depending on where a customer lives, policies might be issued by a company of a different name such as United of Omaha.
Getting a quote through the website requires customers to fill out a form with contact information and location. A licensed agent will then reach out to discuss the various options available. For this reason, it’s not a great choice for anyone looking to handle their insurance entirely online.
Policyholders have access to a customer account on the company website which makes it easy to track claims, find policy information, and make payments. The web portal is also host to a library of helpful information, allowing customers to easily find answers to frequently asked questions about coverage and healthcare.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
It’s difficult to obtain pricing quotes from Mutual of Omaha online. Since laws vary from place to place, the company prefers to have agents reach out to potential customers so they can get the information that’s relevant to them. That being said, Mutual of Omaha typically uses attained-age rated pricing where it’s allowed. With attained-age rated pricing, premiums will increase as customers age, so it’s a good idea to compare quotes from various birth years in your area to see how they might increase as you get older.
Mutual of Omaha does offer a household discount of up to 12% for spouses who both have coverage through the company. You can also access the discount if you’ve been living with another individual over the age of 60 for at least one year and that person also has coverage through Mutual of Omaha.
Mutual of Omaha doesn’t offer simplified quotes on its website. In order to learn more about your options and obtain pricing information, you can fill out a contact form and have an agent contact you. Alternatively, you reach out to the company directly by calling 800-205-8193.
Best for Local and In-Person Service
While best known for its catchy car insurance advertisements, State Farm has a wealth of experience providing Medicare Supplement Insurance across the country.
Like most companies, State Farm does offer a tool to get quotes online. However, the company is unique in the way it uses a network of local agents to help customers select plans. There are State Farm offices located throughout the country, and customers are encouraged to use their local agent as a resource for knowledge and assistance. This makes State Farm an excellent choice for customers who prefer the personal touch of local relationships.
Coverage
State Farm currently offers plans A, C, D, F, G, and N. Coverage in 46 states, but not all plans will be available in all states. The company makes it easy to see which plans are available in every location with a simple online tool. Seniors who are interested in purchasing a plan through State Farm only need to fill out a simple form with some basic information to see which options are available to them. The website itself is easy to navigate, and State Farm does a great job of clarifying commonly asked questions throughout the process.
The company does not currently offer vision, dental, or prescription drug plans. So if customers want this type of coverage, they’ll have to find an alternate provider. However, State Farm does offer a variety of other insurance services, which can be helpful if customers are seeking a single provider for things like auto insurance and home insurance in addition to their Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
State Farm’s pricing models vary from place to place, but the company typically uses the attained-age pricing model where it can. This means that prices will increase as you age.
To get a quote, you’ll need to fill out a small form with your basic information. If you want to continue with the process after getting your initial quote, you’ll fill out a contact form and an agent from State Farm will get in touch with you to continue the process. Alternatively, you can find an agent in your area and go through the entire process with them, which is an excellent option for anyone who prefers in-person contacts.
If customers choose to purchase other types of insurance through State Farm, such as auto insurance or property insurance, they may be eligible for a bundle discount. The specific amount will vary depending on what policies are purchased, but it can lead to generous savings on monthly premiums.

Best for Budget-Conscious Seniors
Founded in 1992, Anthem has become one of the largest insurance companies in the United States. With one in eight Americans currently holding a policy with Anthem, the company has a reputation for providing an outstanding selection of coverage options at competitive rates.
Anthem Blue Cross offers Medicare Supplement plans at rates that can be significantly lower than the competition. And since plans are closely regulated by state and federal government, customers still have the peace of mind knowing that they have the coverage they need.

Coverage
Anthem currently offers plans A, N, G, and F in 14 states across the country (CA, CO, CT, GA, IN, KY, ME, MO, NH, NV, NY, OH, VA and WI). While Anthem’s coverage is limited to 14 states, it is part of the wider Blue Cross Blue Shield network. This means that if Anthem doesn’t provide coverage in your state, you’ll be directed to a list of companies connected with Blue Cross Blue Shield that do.
Anthem’s website is easy to navigate, and potential customers should find it simple to see exactly what’s available in their area and to obtain a quote. It’s also easy to get in touch with an agent who can provide seniors with more detailed information or walk them through the entire sign up process.
The company also offers Medicare Part D, making it a good choice for seniors who are looking for prescription drug coverage. Additionally, customers will find it easy to bundle their Medicare Supplement Insurance with the company’s vision and dental plans.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
Anthem generally uses the attained-age pricing structure, meaning that premiums will increase as the policyholder ages. However, factors such as gender, location, and tobacco use will affect pricing as well.
Anthem’s price comparison tool makes it easy to compare costs on Medicare Supplement Insurance, Medicare Advantage, and a prescription drug plan. The company also offers dental and vision coverage.
Anthem offers a 5% household discount in most states, meaning that if more than one person in a household is enrolled in a Medicare Supplemental Insurance plan through Anthem, each enrolled individual gets the discount. The company also offers small discounts for enrolling in its monthly electronic payments or for paying for an entire year up-front.
While online quotes are not available in all states, we looked at pricing for a non-smoking female living in Hartford, Connecticut who is aging into Medicare. If online quotes are not available in your region, the website will direct you to contact an agent who can help you further.

Coverage
ManhattanLife currently offers plans A, C, F, G, and N. Coverage is available throughout 35 states as well as Puerto Rico. The availability of each individual plan will vary from state to state. Because ManhattanLife is part of a group, other companies within the group may be able to provide coverage where ManhattanLife can not.
While ManhattanLife does offer some optional coverage selections such as vision and dental, it does not offer Medicare Part D, so customers looking for prescription medication coverage will need to do so with a separate provider.
The company’s website is intuitive to navigate and easy to use. It is very transparent with visitors in describing what each plan contains and what is available in each location, so potential customers won’t need to waste their time trying to figure out if this is the best company for them.

Alternatively, interested customers can call an agent directly at 800-877-7703 instead of filling out a contact form.
The company does offer a household discount of up to 7% for customers who live with another adult who is also enrolled in a Medicare Supplement Insurance plan from ManhattanLife.

Best for Coverage in Specialized States
Founded in 1904, Transamerica has evolved into one of the most trusted financial and insurance companies in the country. It has always been invested in protecting not only the financial well being of its customers, but also their physical health and emotional well being. The company prides itself on providing outstanding services and always puts the customer first. It currently holds an A+ (Superior) rating with A.M. Best.
The company offers true nationwide coverage, with plans available in all 50 states. This includes Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, which have specialized Medicare laws. Because of the specialized laws in these states that cause supplement plans to deviate from the common letter plan format, many companies don’t offer plans there. But residents of these states can rest assured that they can find coverage with a reliable, trustworthy company in Transamerica.
Coverage
Transamerica currently offers plans A, F, G, K, and N. Coverage is available in all 50 states and specialized plans are available in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Not all plans will be available in all states.
Transamerica’s plans allow customers to use any doctor across the country that accepts Medicare; there are no network restrictions on any of its plans. While the company does not offer Medicare Part D, it does offer an extensive selection of other insurance and financial planning services including life insurance and retirement planning. This makes Transamerica a good choice for seniors who are also interested in bundling their insurance with other financial planning products.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
Transamerica does not offer any pricing information on its website. In order to get a quote, interested customers need to call and speak directly to an agent. The agent will ask for details about age, location, gender, tobacco use, and coverage start date. More information might be needed to obtain a quote depending on what state the customer lives in, but most people can expect competitive premiums on an attained-age pricing structure.
With Transamerica, discounts will vary depending on location. In many states, customers can get a small discount for enrolling in automatic online payments.
Finding the right Medicare Supplement Insurance provider can be an overwhelming task. There are many different companies offering a wide selection of supplement plans, along with other additional policies. In this buyer’s guide, we’ll walk you through a few simple steps that can help you determine if you need Medicare Supplement Insurance and help you find the company that’s right for you.
Step 1: Determine your Eligibility and if Medicare Supplement Insurance is Right for You
In order to be eligible for a Medicare Supplement plan, you’ll need to have Original Medicare, which is Parts A and B. If you have Medicare Advantage you can not purchase these plans unless you are switching to Original Medicare.
A supplemental insurance plan may be right for you if you wish to add additional coverage that can protect you from unexpected medical expenses in the future. While this means you’ll need to budget for an additional monthly premium, it also means expenses like copayments and deductibles will be covered. Since medical expenses can put a significant strain on your budget, especially if they aren’t planned for, this coverage can provide peace of mind over all of the gaps in Medicare coverage.
Step 2: Understand Your Needs
Once you know that Medicare Supplement Insurance is for you, your next step is to understand your coverage needs. This will depend on several factors, including your current health and financial situation.
For people who are in relatively good health and don’t anticipate needing extensive medical care, plans A, K, and L might be all you need. Since these provide basic coverage, the premiums on these plans tend to be the lowest you can find. C, G, and F fall at the other end of the spectrum with full coverage and generally high premiums. The official U.S. Government website for Medicare provides a detailed chart that can help you understand exactly what each supplement plan covers.
If you are looking for lower premiums, you’ll also want to keep Select plans in mind. These plans offer lower monthly premiums, but you’ll only be able to choose providers from a small, preapproved list.
Step 3: Consider Additional Services and Benefits
If you’re shopping solely for a Medicare Supplement plan, additional services and member benefits may not impact your decisions. But it’s worth considering what other services you might need or could benefit from going forward.
You’ll find that many companies offer Medicare Part D, which is essential if you’re looking for prescription drug coverage. You may also wish to find a company that offers vision, dental, and hearing insurance options so you do not have to go through multiple companies.
Many companies also offer other insurance services such as life, property, home, and auto. If these are insurance services that you need, you might find it convenient to use the same company. You may also be able to get a bundle discount if you hold multiple policies with a single company.
Additionally, some companies offer customers member benefits. These benefits vary from company to company but can include discounts on glasses, wellness products, gym memberships, and travel expenses. Several companies also offer wellness coaching and access to a nurse for health advice.
Step 4: Compare Companies and Gather Quotes
Now that you know what you need, you can narrow your search down to companies that offer what you’re looking for. You should get quotes from at least 3 different companies before making a decision because prices can vary significantly. While many companies offer quotes online, calling an agent can clear up confusion and be a great way to test whether or not you like working with the people at the company.
While comparing quotes, you should also ask about available discounts. Many companies do not advertise discounts directly on their website but will grant them to customers who live in eligible locations when asked. Some common discounts include a household discount when more than one person gets coverage through the company, no tobacco use discounts, automatic payment discounts, annual payment discounts, and new enrollment discounts.
This is also a good time to evaluate the kind of service the company provides. Some companies provide access to local agents, while others are entirely online and over-the-phone operations. You should spend some time on the company’s website to see if you’re comfortable using it as well, since there’s a good chance you’ll be visiting it often to track claims and make payments.
Step 5: Sign Up for Your Chosen Plans During Open Enrollment
It’s important to sign up for your Medicare Supplement plans during your open enrollment period, which is the 6-month period following your 65th birthday. This not only helps to keep your costs as low as possible, but it protects you from being denied coverage for preexisting health conditions.
Each Medicare Supplement plan is standardized, meaning that it must conform with both federal and state laws. These laws are in place to protect customers, and each plan must offer the same basic benefits. You’ll find that some policies may offer additional benefits, allowing you to choose a plan that better meets your individual needs.
While each insurance company decides which supplement plans it wants to offer, state laws may affect what is offered in your area. Insurance companies do not need to offer every policy, but the federal government requires all companies offering Medicare Supplement plans to offer Plan A.
The chart below will give you a quick overview of exactly what each nationwide plan covers.
A note on plans C & F: Beginning on January 1, 2020, plans C & F will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare. However, if you already have either plan your coverage will continue as normal. Additionally, if you were eligible for Medicare before this date but not enrolled yet, you may still be able to access one of these plans.
In the following section you’ll find a brief overview of each Medicare Supplement Plan.
Plan A
Since the federal government requires all insurance companies to offer Plan A if they sell supplemental policies, it’s the most common and generally has the lowest premiums.
Plan A includes coverage for:
Plan B
Plan B is nearly identical to Plan A, but it also includes coverage for Part A deductibles.
Plan C
Plan C includes coverage for a number of additional expenses, including:
As of January 1, 2020, Plan C will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare.
Plan D
Plan D is nearly identical to Plan C, but it does not cover Part B deductibles. Since Plan C is being phased out in 2020, it’s an ideal alternative if you’re seeking that level of coverage.
Plan F
Plan F is considered a “full coverage” plan. It includes:
As of January 1, 2020, Plan F will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare.
Plan G
Plan G is nearly identical to Plan F, but it does not cover Part B deductibles. Since Plan F is being phased out in 2020, Plan G is an ideal alternative for anyone seeking a “full coverage” plan.
Plan K
Plan K is a low coverage with less expensive premiums. It fully covers Part A coinsurance & hospital costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits stop, as well as 50% of the following costs:
Starting in 2020, Plan K will have an out-of-pocket spending limit of $5,880. Once you’ve reached this amount, your plan will cover 100% of your eligible expenses.
Plan L
Plan L is similar to Plan K, but it offers slightly more coverage. It fully covers Part A coinsurance and hospital costs up to 365 days after medicare benefits stop. It also covers 75% of the following costs:
Starting in 2020, Plan L will have an out-of-pocket spending limit of $2,940. Once you’ve reached this amount, your plan will cover 100% of your eligible expenses.
Plan M
Plan M is a medium-coverage plan that includes the following:
Plan N
Plan N is similar to Plan M, with a few minor differences. In this plan, you’ll have coverage for:
If you live in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, or Minnesota, you’ll find that Medicare Supplement Insurance is standardized in different ways. Each state has its own requirements that differ from the letter plans more commonly used across the country and use their own list of Basic Benefits that each plan must cover.
In Massachusetts, Basic Benefits include:
There are two supplement plans available in the state: the Core Plan and Supplement Plan 1.
For a quick side-by-side overview of the plans available in Massachusetts, refer to the table below.
Core Plan
The simplest plan available in Massachusetts is the Core Plan. This includes:
Supplement 1 Plan
Those looking for additional coverage may opt for the Supplement 1 Plan, which includes:
In Wisconsin, Basic Benefits include:
Basic Plan
Wisconsin’s basic plan includes coverage for:
Cost-Sharing Plans
If you would like more coverage than what’s included in the Basic Plan, you have the option to enroll in 25% and 50% cost-sharing plans. Similar to standardized Plans K and L, these cost sharing plans cover 25% or 50% of certain eligible expenses. A high-deductible plan is also available.
Optional Riders
Some insurance providers in Wisconsin offer riders that allow you to customize your supplement plan. These riders include coverage for:
In Minnesota, Basic Benefits include:
There are two supplement plans available in Minnesota: the Basic Plan and the Extended Basic Plan. For a quick side-by-side overview of these plans, refer to the chart below.
*Plan will cover 100% of expenses after you’ve paid $1,000 out-of-pocket in a calendar year.
Basic Plan
Enrolling in the Basic Plan gets you coverage for:
Extended Basic Benefits
Those looking for more coverage might opt for the Extended Basic Benefits Plan. This plan includes coverage for:
Additional Plans and Riders
There are also Minnesota versions of Plans high-deductible F, K, L, M, and N available.
Companies may also offer riders that can be added on to Basic Plan to further customize coverage. These riders include:
When should I purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance?
You’ll want to purchase your Medicare Supplement Insurance during the open enrollment period. Open enrollment is the 6-month period following your 65th birthday. During this timeframe, you’ll be able to enroll in any plan, regardless of any preexisting conditions. If you wait until after this period ends to purchase coverage, you may be faced with higher premiums and companies can deny you coverage.
How much does Medicare Supplement Insurance cost?
Medicare Supplement Insurance prices vary widely from place to place. Other factors like gender, level of coverage, age, and tobacco use can also affect the total cost of a plan. Because of this, there is no one number that accurately estimates the cost. You may be able to find plans that cost less than $100 per month if you’re in search of basic coverage, but you may also encounter plans that cost close to $1,000 or more if you’re looking for maximum protection. This is why it’s important to get quotes from a variety of companies before making a decision.
Am I required to purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance?
No, no one is required to purchase any Medicare Supplement Insurance plans. However, it’s important to keep in mind that Medicare does not cover 100% of your healthcare costs. Even if you’re in relatively good health now, there’s no knowing what will happen in the future, and out-of-pocket medical expenses can quickly become a serious financial strain. Because of this, some form of coverage is recommended.
Are there any savings available for Medicare Supplement Insurance?
Yes, there are various discounts offered by companies that provide Medicare Supplement Insurance. The most common discount is for non-smokers, since people who don’t use tobacco tend to have fewer health problems. Household discounts are also popular, giving people a percentage off of their monthly premiums if they live with another senior who has coverage through the same company. As you shop, you may also find that some companies offer discounts for paying annually or setting up automatic monthly payments.
Where can I go for more information?If you need more assistance or information regarding Medicare, there are a number of different sources available. Medicare.gov is a website managed by the federal government and is an excellent source of information regarding Medicare and Medicare Supplement Insurance. There, you can find forms, resources, compare plans, and find local sources of assistance. Alternatively, you can visit your state’s government website to find more information and locate resources that are close to you.",Medicare Supplement Insurance,10

Here’s the Gist:
Original Medicare (Part A and B) doesn’t have an out-of-pocket limit, but some Medicare Supplement Plans do. This means that after you reach this limit, some Medicare Supplement Plans will cover the rest of the cost of all covered health care services for the rest of the year.
Medicare Supplement Plans have premiums that cost anywhere from around $70/month to around $270/month. Typically, plans with higher monthly premiums will have lower deductibles. Plans with lower monthly premiums typically have higher deductibles.
Read on to learn how you can save on out-of-pocket Original Medicare costs by enrolling in a Medicare Supplement Plan.
When you found out that Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) has no out of pocket maximum, you might have become interested in a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan.
A Medicare Supplement plan helps limit your Medicare out of pocket cost by covering some copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. Some Medicare Supplement plans even have out of pocket limits, meaning they will pay all your covered medical expenses once you’ve paid a certain amount. However, to potentially save money through a Medicare Supplement plan, you first must pay for it. The first way you pay is through a monthly premium.
What is the Medicare Supplement plan premium?
Medicare Supplement plans generally charge premiums, which is a monthly amount you pay to be covered, whether or not you use covered services. The amount of the monthly premium can vary widely. Some plans might charge $70/month for example and some plans might charge $270/month.
What determines the Medicare Supplement plan premium?
Factors that can influence the Medicare Supplement plan price are:
- Which plan you want: there are up to ten Medicare Supplement plans available labeled A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M and N. Medicare Supplement plan A doesn’t cover everything that Medicare Supplement plan F covers, for example. Plans with more coverage may cost more.
- Which insurance company offers the plan
- The geographic area the plan covers
- How the plan is “rated” which is how they factor your age into your cost. Some plans charge the same monthly premium to everyone, regardless of age. Some plans charge according to the age you are when you buy the plan, and some plans charge according to your current age so your premium may increase yearly.
What is a Medicare Supplement deductible?
You may know the word “deductible” from other types of insurance you already have, such as auto insurance. A deductible is an amount you pay before your insurance plan begins to pay. Some Medicare Supplement plans pay the Medicare Part A hospital deductible, but make you pay the Medicare Part B medical deductible. Some plans cover neither the Part A nor the Part B deductible and you will be responsible for those costs out of pocket.
Medicare Supplement high deductible plan F* may charge a lower monthly premium than other plans. However, this low premium may be attached to a high deductible, meaning you must pay a significant amount out of pocket before your Medicare Supplement plan pays anything.
What are other Medicare Supplement plan costs?
Having a Medicare Supplement plan unfortunately doesn’t mean that all your Medicare costs will be covered. You still must pay your Medicare Part B premium and may owe a Medicare Part A premium as well. There is also a limit on what coinsurance costs your Medicare Supplement plan may cover. For example, if you stay in the hospital over 365 days, you may be responsible for all costs. Similarly, if you stay in a skilled nursing facility over 100 days, you may be responsible for all costs. The only way to have a known limit on your costs is to get a plan with an out of pocket maximum.

- You can buy Medigap coverage in any state.
- There are gaps in Medigap coverage.
- Medigap plans that cover the Part B deductible can no longer be purchased by newly-eligible enrollees.
- Medigap insurers set their prices three ways.
- Some Medigap carriers offer discounts.
- The best time to purchase a Medigap policy begins on the first day of the month in which you turn 65 and have enrolled in Medicare A and B.
- An insurer can’t make you wait for Medigap coverage to start.
Because Original Medicare covers a significant portion of its recipients’ healthcare expenses, eligibility for Medicare is a welcome milestone. But for all that Medicare covers, its enrollees learn quickly that Original Medicare doesn’t pick up the tab for everything.
What is Medicare supplement insurance?
Medicare enrollees typically find that they need help with many Medicare expenses – including copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles, in addition to any medical expenses incurred during travel outside the United States and its territories. To cover those expenses, millions of people – more than a third of all Original Medicare beneficiaries – purchase Medicare supplement insurance, also known as Medigap. These plans are designed to fill in the gaps in Medicare and limit enrollees’ out-of-pocket exposure.
Where can you buy Medigap coverage?
Medigap policies are available in every state, from private health insurance carriers. America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) reported in 2019 that total Medigap enrollment in 2017 stood at 13.5 million – up from 11.6 million in 2014.
All Medigap insurers must abide by strict state and federal laws. In most states, Medigap carriers must offer standardized policies that are identified by the letters “A” through “N.” There are a total of ten different plan designs: A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, and although the price varies from one carrier to another, the plan benefits are the same from one state to another and from one carrier to another, within each letter. (As described below, Plans C and F are no longer available to newly eligible enrollees.) So all plan Gs, for example, offer the same benefits — regardless of where you live or what insurance carrier you use. (Medigap policies in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are standardized in a different way.)
In some states, not all types of Medigap coverage will be available. In other states, you may be able to purchase Medicare SELECT – a Medigap policy that requires plan holders to use specific hospitals and, in some cases, specific doctors. Any of the ten Medigap plan designs can be offered as a Medicare SELECT plan, and they tend to be less expensive than typical Medigap policies due to the restricted network. If you choose a Medicare SELECT plan and use a provider that’s not in the network, your Medigap plan won’t pick up your Medicare out-of-pocket costs unless it’s an emergency.
It’s important to note that insurance companies offering Medigap policies are not required to offer every Medigap policy. However, if a carrier offers any Medigap policy, it is required to also offer at least Medigap Plan A, as well as either Plan D or Plan G if the enrollee is new to Medicare, and either Plan C or Plan F if the enrollee became eligible for Medicare prior to 2020.
Are there gaps in Medigap coverage?
Yes. Medigap plans are designed to cover some or all of the out-of-pocket expenses for services that Medicare covers. But they do not cover care that’s not covered at all by Medicare. The list of expenses that Medigap policies don’t cover includes long-term care in a nursing home, vision and dental care, hearing aids, eyeglasses, private-duty nursing care, or prescription drugs. (Plans purchased prior to 2006 were allowed to cover prescriptions, and if you’ve still got one of those plans, you’re allowed to keep it. But Medigap plans sold since 2006 cannot include prescription coverage.)
Also, Medigap policies aren’t compatible with the following types of coverage:
- employer or union plans; veterans’ benefits;
- Indian health services;
- Medicare Advantage plans;
- Medicare prescription drug plans (you’ll need a prescription drug plan in addition to the Medigap policy, since they cover different things.); and
- Medicaid.
Finally, Medigap policies are for individuals only – not for couples or families. So if you and your spouse are both eligible for Medicare, you’ll each need to select an individual Medigap plan. (Some carriers offer a discount if both spouses select the same plan.)
Can new beneficiaries buy Medigap plans that cover the Part B deductible?
There are two Medigap plan designs – Plan F and Plan C – that cover the Medicare Part B deductible. As a result of HR2 (MACRA), which was signed into law in 2015, those plans are no longer available to people who weren’t already eligible for Medicare prior to 2020.
People who were already enrolled in Plan C and Plan F can keep their coverage. And people who were Medicare-eligible prior to the start of 2020 can still apply for Plan C or Plan F. (If they’re outside of their initial enrollment window, carriers will likely use medical underwriting to determine eligibility.)
But people who become eligible for Medicare in 2020 or beyond can no longer purchase Plan C or Plan F. The idea was to eliminate first-dollar coverage under Medigap plans in an effort to prevent over-utilization of healthcare (ie, ensure that enrollees have some “skin in the game” rather than having all of their costs covered by Medicare and supplemental coverage). So people who become eligible for Medicare in 2020 or later can still buy Medigap plans that cover nearly all of their out-of-pocket costs for Medicare-covered services, but they will have to pay the Part B deductible on their own if and when they need outpatient care.
As of 2020, the Part B deductible is $198. (The Part B deductible is a per-year charge, as Medicare’s benefit periods only apply to inpatient care under Medicare Part A.)
How do Medigap insurers set their prices?
The cost of a Medigap policy can vary with each insurance company. There are three ways in which insurers set Medigap rates:
- With community-rated pricing, enrollees are charged the same premium regardless of age. So a 65-year-old enrollee will pay the same premium as an 85-year-old enrollee. Premiums can change over time, but they change by the same amount for all enrollees. There are eight states that require all Medigap plans to be community rated.
- Issue-age-rated premiums are based on the age of the purchaser. So the older the person is at the time of purchase, the higher the premium, and that difference continues as long as they have the plan. For plans with this rating structure, it’s particularly important to enroll as soon as you’re eligible for Medicare coverage, because your premium will always be as low as possible that way.
- With attained-age-rated pricing, the premium goes up as the insured person ages. These plans might be the least expensive option when you’re first eligible for coverage, since you’ll be among the youngest enrollees. But as you get older, the price will increase based on your age as well as factors like inflation and overall medical cost trends.
Be aware that Medigap plans in most states are only guaranteed issue during the six-month window that starts the month you turn 65 (or when you enroll in Medicare Part B, which might be after you turn 65 if you still had employer-sponsored coverage), and during limited special enrollment periods. There’s no annual open enrollment period like there is for Medicare Advantage, Medicare D, and Original Medicare.
If you don’t enroll during your initial enrollment period, you may have to pay a higher premium – or be declined altogether – if you’re in poor health, as carriers are allowed to use medical underwriting after your initial enrollment period has passed.
How can I pay less for Medigap coverage?
Make sure you enroll as soon as you’re eligible, in order to get coverage that’s guaranteed issue with no premium rate-ups based on your medical history.
Some Medigap carriers offer discounts that might apply to you. Some insurers offer discounts for women, non-smokers, married people, and for paying annually. States also offer a health insurance assistance program, providing up-to-date Medigap insurance information and a list of qualified private insurers. Check our state pages to find your state’s assistance program.
Is there a best time to purchase a Medigap policy?
The best window of time in which to buy a Medigap policy begins on the first day of the month in which you’re at least 65 and enrolled in Medicare A and B (you have to be enrolled in both Medicare A and B in order to get a Medigap plan). This is the start of your initial enrollment period, and it lasts for six months. Under federal rules, Medigap coverage in every state is guaranteed during this window.
If you’re eligible for Medicare because of a disability, the majority of the states offer at least some sort of guaranteed issue enrollment periods for those under 65. (In many cases the coverage is more expensive for those under 65. You can click on your state on this map to see how the rules work.) So it pays to research your state’s health care regulations. (Contact your state SHIP office or Department of Insurance for more details).
If you wait to buy a policy until after your initial enrollment period, your carrier generally has the option of denying the application or charging a higher premium based on the company’s underwriting requirements, as there is no federal requirement that Medigap plans be guaranteed-issue outside of the initial enrollment window and very limited special enrollment periods. But states can set their own regulations for Medigap plans:
- In New York and Connecticut, Medigap plans are not medically underwritten, regardless of when an applicant enrolls.
- In Massachusetts, there’s an annual guaranteed-issue Medigap open enrollment period each year, from February 1 through March 31.
- In Maine, Medigap insurers must designate one month each year when Plan A is guaranteed issue, regardless of the applicant’s medical history.
- Missouri‘s “anniversary rule” allows enrollees to switch from one Medigap insurer to another (as long as both plans are the same letter) on a guaranteed-issue basis during a window each year that extends for 30 days before and 30 days after the anniversary of when the plan was first purchased.
- In California and Oregon, Medigap enrollees have a 30-day window each year, following the enrollee’s birthday, when he or she can switch to any other available Medigap plan that has equal or lesser benefits, without medical underwriting.
- Washington State allows those already enrolled in Medigap plans to switch to another Medigap plan at any time, as long as they’ve had coverage for at least 90 days. Those with Medigap Plan A are limited to switching to only another Plan A. But people with Medigap Plans B through N can switch to any other Plan B through N.
Check with your state SHIP or your state’s Department of Insurance for more information about state-based regulations regarding Medigap.
Will I have to wait for my Medigap policy to take effect?
An insurer can’t make you wait for your coverage to start, but it can make you wait for coverage of a pre-existing condition – and may also refuse to cover your out-of-pocket costs for that pre-existing condition for up to six months during a pre-existing condition waiting period. That said, if you recently had “credible coverage” – or if you have guaranteed issue “Medigap protection” – you may be able to shorten or avoid entirely the waiting period.

26,https://www.medicaremadeclear.com/basics/medicare-supplement-insurance-costs-and-coverage,"There are 10 standardized Medicare supplement insurance plans, labeled “A” through “N.” (These letters are not related to the Medicare Part A, B, C and D labels.) The plans and what they cover are prescribed by the federal government. What Does Medicare Supplement Insurance Cover?
The main purpose of a Medicare supplement plan is to cover some of the out-of-pocket costs not paid by Medicare Parts A and B, like deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance. Each of the standardized plans provides benefits for different out-of-pocket costs.
Each standardized plan with the same letter must offer the same basic benefits, no matter which insurance company sells it. For example the basic benefits of one company’s Plan F are the same as the basic benefits of another company’s Plan F. The only difference between Medicare supplement plans with the same letter sold by different insurance companies is usually cost.
What Does Medicare Supplement Insurance Cost?
The table shows the types of costs you may have with a Medicare supplement insurance plan. You need to look at individual plans to understand their specific costs. How Medicare Supplement Insurance Works
Each standardized Medicare supplement insurance plan covers different types of out-of-pocket costs. So what you pay in out-of-pocket costs will depend on what services you use and which plan you have.
This is a little confusing, so let’s use an example.
Suppose a person has Original Medicare (Parts A and B) and receives the following covered services:
- 15 days as an inpatient in the hospital
- 22 days in a skilled nursing facility
- 2 visits with a doctor who doesn’t accept Medicare assignment
The table below compares what the person's out-of-pocket cost for these services might be with different Medicare supplement insurance plans.This example assumes that the Part B deductible is met for the year. The costs shown are for illustration only. Actual costs may be different.
So depending on which Medicare supplement insurance plan the person in this example has, some or all of their out-of-pocket costs could be covered. In general, plans that cover more costs have higher premiums.
Enrolling in a Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan
You have a specific enrollment period for Medicare supplement insurance called the Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period. This period:
- Begins the first month that you are age 65 or older and enrolled in Medicare Part B
- Lasts for 6 months
- Guarantees your right to buy a plan (You cannot be denied coverage if you apply during this period.)
Even if you miss your open enrollment period, you may apply for Medicare supplement insurance at any time. You could be denied coverage, though, or charged a higher premium based on your health history. Some states have additional Medicare supplement open enrollment periods, including for beneficiaries under age 65.",Medicare Supplement Insurance,14
27,https://www.bcbs.com/medicare/medigap,"Medigap (Medicare Supplement)
If you are enrolled in Medicare Part A and B (Original Medicare), Medigap plans can help fill the coverage gaps in Medicare Part A and Part B. Medigap plans are sold by private insurance companies and are designed to assist you with out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductibles, copays and coinsurance) not covered by Parts A and B. These plans are available in all 50 states and can vary in premiums and enrollment eligibility. Medigap plans are standardized; however, all of the standardized plans may not be available in your area.
Costs
Limits and Considerations
Limits
Most of the time, Medigap coverage has no network limitations and is available anywhere that Medicare is accepted.
Things to Consider
- Some Medigap plans cover foreign travel emergency services.
- Once you are enrolled in a plan, it renews every year as long as you pay your premium and the plan is available.
Initial Enrollment Period
The Initial Enrollment Period is a limited window of time when you can enroll in Original Medicare (Part A and/or Part B) when you are first eligible. After you are enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B, you can select other coverage options like a Medigap (Medicare Supplement) plan from approved private insurers. The best time to buy a Medigap policy is the six-month period that starts the first day of the month that you turn 65 or older and enrolled in Part B. After this period, your ability to buy a Medigap policy may be limited and it may be more costly. Each state handles things differently, but there are additional open enrollment periods in some cases.
Your Initial Enrollment Period is based on the month in which you turn 65. It begins three months before your birth month and extends until three months after your birth month.
Example: If you are born on June 18, 1952, your Initial Enrollment Period is from March 1, 2017 until September 30, 2017.
Your Initial Enrollment Period is based on when you began receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) disability benefits. It begins the 22nd month after you began receiving benefits and continues until the 28thmonth after you began receiving benefits.
Example: If you are began receiving disability benefits in January 2015, your Initial Enrollment Period is from November 1, 2016 until May 31, 2017.
How to Enroll
You must first enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B before joining a Medigap (Medicare Supplement) plan. Contact your local Blue Cross Blue Shield company for help choosing a Medigap (Medicare Supplement) plan and getting enrolled.
Open Enrollment Period
The open enrollment period for Medicare runs from October 15 through December 7 on an annual basis, however, this is not the case for individuals interested in Medigap (Medicare Supplement) coverage. The open enrollment period for a Medigap policy is the six-month period that starts the first day of the month that you turn 65 or older and enrolled in Part B. After this period, your ability to buy a Medigap policy may be limited and it may be more costly. Each state handles things differently, but there are additional open enrollment periods in some cases.

In addition to enrolling in a Medicare plan to meet your anticipated needs, you’ll also have to decide if a Medicare Supplement plan is right for you.
At Erie Insurance, we’re here to help. Here are some things you should know when considering a Medicare Supplement plan.
What is a Medicare Supplement plan?
Medicare Parts A and B provide insurance coverage for health-related expenses, but they don’t cover all of the health care costs you may have. A Medicare Supplement plan, sometimes called “Medigap,” is a private insurance policy that can help pay for some of the health care costs that Medicare doesn’t cover. This can include out-of-pocket expenses such as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles.
With health care and out-of-pocket costs for Medicare participants on the rise, a Medicare Supplement plan can help set your mind at ease.
What does a Medicare Supplement plan cover?
Medicare Supplement plans are designed to help pay for the costs that you would normally pay out of your own pocket. But the costs and benefits will depend on which Medicare Supplement plan you select.
Erie Family Life offers four supplemental insurance plans designed to meet your needs and fit your budget. They include:
- Plan A: This plan includes basic benefits to help with copayments for services covered under Medicare Parts A and B.
- Plan B: Available only in Pennsylvania, this plan provides the same benefits as Plan A but also pays your Medicare Part A hospital deductible.
- Plan F: This plan offers the most coverage of all our Medicare Supplement plans. It covers all out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses covered by your Medicare Supplement insurance. Beginning Jan. 1, 2020, this plan will no longer be available to those becoming newly eligible for coverage.
- Plan G: Beginning Jan. 1, 2020, Plan G will be the go-to plan for new Medicare enrollees. It includes the same basic benefits as Plan F, including Part B excess charges and Foreign Travel Emergency coverage.
- Plan N: This is our middle-of-the-road coverage offering. Under Plan N, you’ll pay a lower premium in exchange for taking on a small annual deductible and some copayments. It covers your Medicare Part B copays, as well as your hospital deductible, copays and coinsurance.
Am I eligible for a Medicare Supplement plan?
You can apply for a Medicare Supplement plan policy if you are age 65 or over and enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. The one-time Open Enrollment period, which begins on the first day of the month an individual is 65 or older and enrolled in Part B provides for guaranteed issue. Individuals under age 65 eligible for and enrolled in Part B; are not eligible for guaranteed issue unless they have lost or are losing creditable coverage. In some states, Medicare Supplement insurance policies are available to people with disabilities who are under the age 65.

A Medigap policy is health insurance sold by private insurance companies to fill the “gaps” in Original Medicare Plan coverage. Medigap policies help pay some of the health care costs that the Original Medicare Plan doesn't cover. If you are in the Original Medicare Plan and have a Medigap policy, then Medicare and your Medigap policy will each pay its share of covered health care costs.
Generally, when you buy a Medigap policy you must have Medicare Part A and Part B. You will have to pay the monthly Medicare Part B premium. In addition, you will have to pay a premium to the Medigap insurance company. As long as you pay your premium, your Medigap policy is guaranteed renewable. This means it is automatically renewed each year. Your coverage will continue year after year as long as you pay your premium. In some states, insurance companies may refuse to renew a Medigap policy bought before 1992.
Insurance companies can only sell you a “standardized” Medigap policy. Medigap policies must follow Federal and state laws. These laws protect you. The front of a Medigap policy must clearly identify it as “Medicare Supplement Insurance.”
It's important to compare Medigap policies, because costs can vary. The standardized Medigap policies that insurance companies offer must provide the same benefits. Generally, the only difference between Medigap policies sold by different insurance companies is the cost.
You and your spouse must buy separate Medigap policies.Your Medigap policy won't cover any health care costs for your spouse.
Some Medigap policies also cover other extra benefits that aren't covered by Medicare.
You are guaranteed the right to buy a Medigap policy under certain circumstances.

What Is Medicare Supplement Insurance?
Medicare Supplement Insurance is an insurance policy that supplements Original Medicare (Parts A and B). It helps pay for the portion of healthcare costs that Original Medicare doesn’t cover.
Medicare Supplement or Medigap
There is no difference between Medigap and Medicare Supplement Insurance. They are simply two different terms for the same type of insurance coverage. Please note that Medicare Supplement is NOT the same as Medicare Advantage. They are two separate insurance products.

Coverage for costs not paid by Medicare
A Medicare Supplement Insurance policy (also called a Medigap plan) can help pay some of the health care costs and services that Original Medicare doesn't cover, such as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. Medicare will pay its share of the Medicare-approved amount for covered health costs. Then your Medicare Supplement Insurance policy will pay its share.

Also referred to as Medicare Supplement Plan F, it covers both Medicare deductibles and all copays and coinsurance, leaving you with nothing out of pocket. This post has been updated for 2020.
Medicare supplement Plan F has also been the #1 seller with Baby Boomers for many years. According to a report from America’s Health Insurance professionals, about 57% of all Medigap policies in force were a premium Medicare Plan F policy. (In recent years, Plan G has been the second most popular Medicare supplement plan, and you can read more on that below.)
A Medigap plan, or Medicare Supplement, pays after Medicare to help cover your deductibles, copays, and coinsurance that you would otherwise be responsible for. Medigap plans do not replace your Medicare Part B. You must be enrolled in both Part A and Part B first, then you are eligible to enroll in Medicare supplement Plan F.
When you add a Medicare Supplement Plan F or G to your Original Medicare benefits, your coverage will be quite comprehensive. By definition, Medigap Plan F is the Medicare supplement policy with the most benefits.
(Sometimes people refer to Plan F as Medicare Part F or Medigap Part F, but correct terminology is Plan F. Just remember: only Medicare itself has Parts.)

Never Pay a Doctor Copay Again
The reason Medicare Plan F is so well-liked is that it will pay for ALL of the gaps in Original Medicare Part A and Part B, including both your hospital and outpatient deductible. It even pays the 20% that Medicare Part B does not cover.
This means zero out-of-pocket for you at the doctor’s office.
So when you are asking which Medicare plan is best, it’s pretty easy to see why so many people think Plan F is the best Medicare supplement plan.

Medicare Supplement Plan F Coverage is Comprehensive
Medicare Plan F policies are considered first-dollar coverage. After Medicare pays its share of your claims, Medigap Plan F pays the remainder. This leaves you with $0 out of pocket.
- Plan F fully covers both your Part A hospital deductible and your Part B outpatient deductible
- It covers all of the 20% that Medicare Part B normally leaves for you to pay
- Medicare Plan F covers all Part B excess charges. You will never pay the standard 15% excess charges that doctors under Medicare are allowed to charge for Part B services
- Choose any doctor – from over 880,000 physicians in the United States

As you can see, Medicare supplement Plan F coverage is thorough and buys you peace of mind. Many people also ask us: Are all Medicare Plan F the same? The answer is yes. No matter which insurance company you buy your policy from, the benefits are the same.
Medicare Plan F Pays your Deductibles AND Co-insurance
Here’s an example: if you have no supplement, you would owe a $1,408 deductible (Part A deductible in 2020) when you go to the hospital. You would also pay 20% of expensive procedures like surgery because Part B only pays 80%.
If you had a Medigap F policy, though, all of these would be paid for by your insurance.
You might be surprised to learn that there are many solid insurance companies with good financial ratings that offer rates lower than the big brand-name carriers. Get a free quote for Medigap F right here.

Medigap F Cost Example
Gracie applies for a Plan F Medigap and the insurance company approves her. The following year she sees an orthopedic specialist about problems with her knee. Medicare pays 80% of the cost of this visit to her specialist. Plan F covers the other 20% owed under Part B. Gracie owes nothing.
The specialist sends her to an imaging facility to have an MRI done on her knee. Medicare pays 80% of the cost of her MRI. Medicare F pays the other 20%. Gracie pays absolutely nothing.
The results of the MRI show serious problems. Her orthopedic specialist tells Gracie that she is a candidate for a total knee replacement. She undergoes surgery at her local hospital and is in the hospital a couple of days. Gracie also has a home health care nurse come out to her home several times in the weeks following her surgery.
The total cost for Gracie’s surgery, hospital stay and follow-up care is $70,000. Medicare pays its share of the bills and sends the remainder of about $14,000 to Gracie’s supplemental insurance carrier. The carrier pays the entire bill, and Gracie owes absolutely nothing for any of these Part A and Part B services. Her only out-of-pocket spending would be for medications.
That means the cost of Medicare Supplement Plan F is really only the premiums that you pay for the plan itself. Medicare Supplement Plan F rates will vary by insurance company, but you can rest assured there is no back-end spending.

Common Questions about Medigap Plan F
Original Medicare itself has 4 Parts – A, B, C and D. That’s it. The correct term is Plan F but sometimes when people are new to Medicare, they use the wrong and call it Medicare Part F. An easy way to remember it would be that Medicare has parts and Medigap has plans.
People who were eligible for Medicare prior to 2020 will continue to have the option to buy Part F.
It covers all of your cost-sharing for Medicare Part A and B services.
All Medigap plans cover medications administered in the hospital or in a clinical setting. However, Medigap plans do not cover retail prescriptions. You will want to enroll in Part D to get your retail prescription drugs covered.
No Medigap plan covers routine dental, vision or hearing services either. However, there are many great standalone plans that you can enroll in to provide these benefits at a reasonable cost. Our agency offers one that lets you use your own providers and the benefits grow over time.

No. Plan G covers less than Medicare supplemental Plan F. You pay your own Part B deductible. However, you get lower premiums for Plan G, and sometimes that makes it a better value. Be sure to compare the numbers. In my opinion, the best Medicare plan is the one that will cost you the least annual out-of-pocket spending and has the lowest rate increases in recent years.
Is Medicare Plan F going away?
Lots of people ask us about Medicare Plan F going away. Yes, in 2020, they Plan F is being phased out. It will be no longer be available for new enrollees. Medicare beneficiaries who are already enrolled in it, though, will be able to keep it. Congress passed legislation that will no longer allow Medicare supplement policies to cover the Part B deductible for newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries on or after January 1, 2020.
So should you join Plan F before it gets discontinued? Or would it be better to enroll in Plan G since it will be around long-term?
There are agents out there who will try to switch you out of Plan F by using the coming 2020 changes as a scare tactic. Don’t let anyone panic you. You should enroll in the plan that makes the most financial sense for you. We advise you to get quotes for both plans, which is what we do for our clients here.
We often find that Plan G is actually a better value. The premiums you save annually on Plan G are often more than the Part B deductible that you pay out. If that’s the case, then we think that enrolling in Plan G makes sense.
