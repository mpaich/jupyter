Find out which insurance companies sell Medigap policies in your area.
Medigap policies are standardized
Every Medigap policy must follow federal and state laws designed to protect you, and it must be clearly identified as ""Medicare Supplement Insurance."" Insurance companies can sell you only a ""standardized"" policy identified in most states by letters.
All policies offer the same basic Benefits [Glossary]
but some offer additional benefits, so you can choose which one meets your needs. In Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, Medigap policies are standardized in a different way.
Each insurance company decides which Medigap policies it wants to sell, although state laws might affect which ones they offer. Insurance companies that sell Medigap policies:
- Don't have to offer every Medigap plan
- Must offer Medigap Plan A if they offer any Medigap policy
- Must also offer Plan C or Plan F if they offer any plan
Note
As of January 1, 2020, Medigap plans sold to new people with Medicare aren't allowed to cover the Part B deductible. Because of this, Plans C and F are not available to people new to Medicare starting on January 1, 2020. If you already have either of these 2 plans (or the high deductible version of Plan F) or are covered by one of these plans before January 1, 2020, you’ll be able to keep your plan. If you were eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, but not yet enrolled, you may be able to buy one of these plans.

Compare Medigap plans side-by-side
The chart below shows basic information about the different benefits Medigap policies cover.
Yes = the plan covers 100% of this benefit
No = the policy doesn't cover that benefit
% = the plan covers that percentage of this benefit
N/A = not applicable
* Plans F and G also offer a high-deductible plan in some states. With this option, you must pay for Medicare-covered costs (coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles) up to the deductible amount of $2,340 in 2020 before your policy pays anything. (Plans C and F aren't available to people who are newly eligible for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020.)
** For Plans K and L, after you meet your out-of-pocket yearly limit and your yearly Part B deductible ($198 in 2020), the Medigap plan pays 100% of covered services for the rest of the calendar year.
*** Plan N pays 100% of the Part B coinsurance, except for a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to a $50 copayment for emergency room visits that don't result in inpatient admission.

*Plan F has an option called a high deductible Plan F. This option is not currently offered by UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company. This high deductible plan pays the same benefits as Plan F after you have paid a calendar year deductible of $2,340 in 2020. Benefits from high deductible Plan F will not begin until out-of-pocket expenses exceed $2,340 in 2020. Out-of-pocket expenses for this deductible are expenses that would ordinarily be paid by the policy. These expenses include the Medicare deductibles for Part A and Part B, but do not include the plan's separate foreign travel emergency deductible.
**NY: In New York, the Excess Charge is limited to 5%; PA and OH: Under Pennsylvania and Ohio law, a physician may not charge or collect fees from Medicare patients which exceed the Medicare-approved Part B charge. Plans F and G pay benefits for excess charges when services are rendered in a jurisdiction not having a balance billing law; TX: In Texas, the amount cannot exceed 15% over the Medicare approved amount or any other charge limitation established by the Medicare program or state law. Note that the limiting charge applies only to certain services and does not apply to some supplies and durable medical equipment; VT: Vermont law generally prohibits a physician from charging more than the Medicare approved amount. However, there are exceptions and this prohibition may not apply if you receive services out of state.
†Care needed immediately because of an injury or an illness of sudden and unexpected onset. Benefit is 80% and beneficiaries are responsible for 20% after the $250 annual deductible with a $50,000 lifetime maximum for medically necessary emergency care received outside the U.S. during the first 60 days of each trip.

Do you have fairly frequent doctor or hospital visits? If so, you may already know that Medicare Part A and Part B come with out-of-pocket costs you have to pay. You might be able to save money with a Medicare Supplement insurance plan. Medicare Supplement, or Medigap, insurance plans fill in “gaps” in basic benefits left behind by Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.
In 47 states, there are up to 10 standardized Medicare Supplement insurance plans that are denoted by the letters A through N (plans E, H, I, and J are no longer sold). The private insurance companies offering these plans do not have to offer every Medicare Supplement plan, but they must offer at least Plan A.
Please note that although the names may sound similar, the “parts” of Medicare, such as Part A and Part B, are not the same as Medigap Plan A, Plan B, etc.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan basic benefits
Each Medicare Supplement insurance plan offers a different level of basic benefits, but each lettered plan must include the same standardized basic benefits regardless of insurance company and location. For example, Medicare Supplement Plan G in Florida includes the same basic benefits as Plan G in North Dakota. Please note that if you live in Massachusetts, Minnesota, or Wisconsin, your Medicare Supplement insurance plan options are different than in the rest of the country. Medicare Supplement insurance plans do not have to cover vision, dental, long-term care, or hearing aids, but all plans must cover at least a portion of the following basic benefits:
- Medicare Part A coinsurance costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are exhausted
- Medicare Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayments
- Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayments
- First three pints of blood used in a medical procedure
Some plans include additional basic benefits. For example, Medicare Supplement Plan F*, the most comprehensive standardized Medigap insurance plan, carries the following additional benefits:
- Medicare Part A deductible
- Medicare Part B deductible*
- Part B excess charges
- Part B preventive care coinsurance
- Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) care coinsurance
- Foreign travel emergency care (80% of Medicare-approved costs, up to plan limits)
Some plans may include additional innovative benefits.
*Medicare Supplement plans that may cover the Medicare Part B deductible – Medicare Supplement Plans C and F – will be phased out. If you’re not eligible for Medicare until January 1, 2020 or later, you won’t be able to buy Plan C or Plan F. You won’t generally have to give up your Plan C or Plan F if you already have one. If you’re eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, you might be able to buy Plan C or Plan F.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan costs
Although private insurance companies are required to offer the same basic benefits for each lettered plan, they do have the ability to charge different premiums. You might want to shop around to find a Medicare Supplement insurance plan that may fit your medical and financial needs. Insurance companies may price their plan premiums in any of the following ways:
- Community no-age-rated: These Medicare Supplement insurance plans charge premiums that are the same across the board, regardless of age.
- Issue-age-rated: These plans base their premiums on your age when you first enrolled in the policy. Therefore, the younger you are when you enroll in this type of plan, the lower your premium will be.
- Attained-age-rated: Like issue-age-rated, these plans base their premiums on the age you were when you first bought a policy, but unlike issue-age-rated, premiums increase as you get older.
Please note that no matter what rating method an insurance company uses, premiums may increase over time for reasons other than age, such as inflation.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan enrollment and eligibility
To be eligible to enroll in a Medicare Supplement insurance plan, you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B. A good time to enroll in a plan is generally during the Medigap Open Enrollment Period, which begins on the first day of the month that you are both age 65 or older and enrolled in Part B, and lasts for six months. During this period, you have a guaranteed-issue right to join any Medicare Supplement insurance plan available where you live. You may not be denied basic benefits based on any pre-existing conditions** during this enrollment period (although a waiting period may apply). If you miss this enrollment period and attempt to enroll in the future, you may be denied basic benefits or charged a higher premium based on your medical history. In some states, you may be able to enroll in a Medigap plan before the age of 65.
**Pre-existing conditions are generally health conditions that existed before the start of a policy. They may limit coverage, be excluded from coverage, or even prevent you from being approved for a policy; however, the exact definition and relevant limitations or exclusions of coverage will vary with each plan, so check a specific plan’s official plan documents to understand how that plan handles pre-existing conditions

Medicare Supplement (also known as Medigap or MedSupp) insurance plans help cover certain out-of-pocket costs that Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, doesn’t cover. There are 10 plan types available in most states, and each plan is labeled with a different letter that corresponds with a certain level of basic benefits.
In most states, Medigap insurance plans have the same standardized benefits for each letter category. This means that the basic benefits for a Plan A, for example, is the same across every insurance company that sells Plan A, regardless of location. This makes it easy to compare Medicare Supplement insurance plans because the main difference between plans of the same letter category will be the premium cost.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin standardize their Medicare Supplement insurance plans differently from the rest of the country. In all states, insurance companies that sell Medicare Supplement insurance aren’t required to offer all plan types. However, any insurance company that sells Medigap insurance is required by law to offer Medigap Plan A. If an insurance company wants to offer other Medigap plans, it must sell either Plan C or Plan F in addition to any other plans it would like to sell.
The chart below allows you to compare Medicare Supplement insurance plans based on what’s offered across the standardized plans that are available in most states.
* There is also a high-deductible version of Plan F where beneficiaries pay a deductible of $2,300 in 2019 before the Medigap plan begins to cover Medicare-covered costs.
An important note about Medicare Supplement Plans F and C: You may not be able to buy these plans if you qualify for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. That includes high-deductible Plan F. If you already have one of these plans, you won’t have to give it up.
You might be able to get a high-deductible Medicare Supplement Plan G in 2020, according to America’s Health Insurance Plans (ahip.org). It doesn’t pay for the Medicare Part B deductible.
** After the out-of-pocket limit (including the Medicare Part B deductible) is reached for Plans K or L, the Medigap plan pays 100% of Medicare-covered services for the remainder of the calendar year.
***Plan N pays 100% of the Medicare Part B coinsurance costs, with the exception of a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to $50 for emergency room visits that don’t result in the beneficiary being admitted as an inpatient.
****Medically Necessary Emergency Care in a Foreign Country: coverage to the extent not covered by Medicare for 80 percent of the billed charges for Medicare-eligible expenses for medically necessary emergency hospital, physician and medical care received in a foreign country, which care would have been covered by Medicare if provided in the United States and which care began during the first 60 consecutive days of each trip outside the United States, subject to a calendar year deductible of $250, and a lifetime maximum benefit of $50,000. For purposes of this benefit, “emergency care” shall mean care needed immediately because of an injury or an illness of sudden and unexpected onset.

Anyone who's ready to sign up for Medicare has a lot of decisions to make. But one decision is especially important: Should you choose Medicare Advantage or use Medigap to supplement your Original Medicare plan?
Key Takeaways
- Traditional Medicare provides good basic health coverage, but it pays only about 80% of approved costs for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures and usually doesn't cover prescription drug costs or such things as routine dental care.
- Medigap supplemental insurance plans are designed to fill Medicare Part A and Part B coverage gaps.
- To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance) within the seven-month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
- You can choose to get your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits through a Medicare Advantage plan. They often include benefits beyond Part A and Part B. Private, Medicare-approved health insurance companies offer these plans.
- Although Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is optional, if you don’t get it as either as a stand-alone plan or as part of a Medicare Advantage plan, there may be financial penalties if you need to buy a policy later on because you need expensive drugs.
- Consider plan costs, plan doctors, convenience, your lifestyle and travel plans, your health, and any additional benefits in making your Medicare coverage choices.
Medicare Coverage
Budgeting for healthcare costs in retirement is tough since there’s usually no way of knowing whether your expenses each year will be minimal or huge. While traditional Medicare (Part A and Part B) provides good basic coverage, it pays only about 80% of the costs it approves for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. The other 20% of the bill is the individual’s responsibility and—unlike coverage under the Affordable Care Act—there is no cap on the amount a person might have to pay in one year.
Let's say, for example, that you need heart bypass surgery. The cost would be a minimum of $85,891, according to the American Heart Association , and you would be responsible for a co-pay of $17,178—or much more if there are complications or something else goes wrong. In addition, some health needs, such as prescription drugs, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and dental care, are not covered at all by regular Medicare (Part A and Part B).
There are two basic ways for recipients to fill most of these coverage gaps and reduce the risk of tremendous bills in a bad health year:
- Medicare Plus Medigap Supplemental Insurance Policies
- Medicare Advantage Plans
Medicare Plus Medigap Supplemental Insurance Policies
About two-thirds of the 61 million seniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries choose traditional Medicare, Parts A and B, which cover hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. About 80% of these beneficiaries supplement their insurance with Medigap (Medicare Supplement) insurance, Medicaid, employer-sponsored insurance, and/or stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies.
Medicare Supplement insurance plans are not connected with or endorsed by the U.S. government or the federal Medicare program.
While this may be the more expensive option, it has a few advantages. Both Medicare and Medigap insurance plans cover you for any hospital or doctor in the U.S. that accepts Medicare, and the great majority do. There is no need for prior authorization or a referral from a primary care doctor. Coverage includes the entire U.S., which may be important for those who travel frequently or spend part of the year in a different locale. This option is also attractive to those who have particular physicians and hospitals they want to use.
Medicare Advantage Plans
Available from private, Medicare-approved insurance companies, Medicare Advantage policies (Part C) are marketed to consumers under such names as Aetna, Humana, and Kaiser Foundation Medicare plans. They may have no premium or a lower one compared to the significant premiums for Medigap and prescription drug insurance policies. Medicare Advantage plans cover hospitals and doctors and often also include prescription drug coverage and some services not covered by Medicare. A little more than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries choose one of these plans.
Most Medicare Advantage plans operate as health maintenance organization (HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO) insurance. HMOs limit members to using the doctors and hospitals in their networks. PPOs generally let members get care outside the plan's network, but members may have to pay more for such care. Some plans require prior authorization for specialist care or procedures, and/or a referral from a primary care doctor. Plans might not cover care given outside of the network’s geographical area. Extra benefits not covered by regular Medicare, such as eyeglasses, routine dental care, or gym memberships, may be offered.
When to Sign Up for Medicare
As you approach age 65, it’s important to know which enrollment deadlines apply to your circumstances to avoid costly fines and gaps in coverage. Begin by checking on your eligibility. To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospitals) and Part B (doctors) in the seven month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
If you currently get Social Security, you will be automatically enrolled; if not, you need to sign up either online or at your Social Security office.
Medicare Part B
If you are working at age 65, however, and you have employer insurance through a company with more than 20 employees, you have the right to stay on your employer insurance and delay signing up for Medicare Part B until your employer coverage ends. If you work for an employer with fewer than 20 employees, it is very important to ask the employer whether you are required to sign up for Medicare and get that decision in writing.
Medicare Part D
You need to be signed up for Medicare Parts A and B before you can enroll in a Medicare Advantage (Part C) plan. Once you’ve enrolled in Medicare, a key decision point is choosing coverage for Part D prescription drug insurance. If you don’t enroll in Part D insurance when you start Medicare and want to buy drug coverage later on, you may be permanently penalized for signing up late.
You can avoid the penalty, however, if you have what's known as creditable prescription drug coverage, which is prescription drug coverage (from an employer or union, for example) that’s expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. If you have this kind of drug coverage when you become eligible for Medicare, you are generally allowed to keep it. You generally won't have to pay a penalty if you later decide to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and you haven't gone for longer than 63 continuous days without creditable coverage.
Many Medicare Advantage plans include Part D drug insurance, but a stand-alone policy can also be purchased for those who choose regular Medicare (Part A and Part B) or a Medicare Advantage plan that doesn’t include Part D.
Choosing Traditional Medicare Plus a Medigap Plan
Regular or traditional Medicare comprises Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance). You can supplement this coverage with a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and a Medigap supplemental insurance plan. While signing up for Medicare gets you into Parts A and B, you have to take action on your own to buy these supplemental policies.
Finding Part D, Drug Insurance
To get started, find the plans available in your zip code. Once you have created an account at Medicare.gov, you can enter the names of your drugs and use a convenient tool that allows you to compare plan premiums, deductibles, and Medicare star ratings.
If you don’t take many (or any) prescription drugs, look for a plan with a low monthly premium. All plans must still cover most drugs used by people with Medicare. If, on the other hand, you have high prescription drug costs, check into plans that cover your drugs in the donut hole, the coverage gap period that kicks in after you and the plan have spent $4,020 on covered drugs in 2020.
Selecting a Medigap (supplemental) Plan: Recent Changes Limit Choices
Medigap policies are private plans, available from insurance companies or through brokers, but not on medicare.gov. They are labeled Plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, each with a different standardized coverage set. Some plans include emergency medical benefits during foreign travel. Since coverage is standard, there are no ratings of Medigap policies. Consumers can confidently compare insurer’s prices for each letter plan and simply choose the better deal.
As of Jan. 1, 2020, Medigap plans sold to new Medicare beneficiaries aren't allowed to cover the Part B deductible.
Until recently, most people (66%) who bought Medigap policies chose Plan F, which gave the most comprehensive coverage, including paying for the Medicare Part B deductible ($198 in 2020).12 However, in an effort to trim Medicare expenses, Congress suspended Plans C and F for people who become Medicare-eligible in 2020 and beyond.
Plan D and Plan G have similar benefits to Plan C and Plan F, except for not covering the Part B deductible. People who signed up or became eligible for Medicare before 2020 can purchase or continue Plans C or F, though prices may rise and it may be a better deal to switch to a plan that doesn’t cover the deductible.
Choosing a Medicare Advantage Plan
Medicare Advantage Health Plans are similar to private health insurance. Most services, such as office visits, lab work, surgery, and many others, are covered after a small co-pay. Plans might offer an HMO or PPO network and all plans place a yearly limit on total out-of-pocket expenses. Each plan has different benefits and rules. Most provide prescription drug coverage. Some require a referral to see a specialist while others won’t. Some may pay a portion of out-of-network care, while others will cover only doctors and facilities that are in the HMO or PPO network. There are also other types of Medicare Advantage plans.
Selecting a plan with a low or no annual premium can be important. But its also essential to check on co-pay and coinsurance costs, especially for expensive hospital stays and procedures, to estimate your possible annual expenses. Since care is often limited to in-network physicians and hospitals, the quality and size of a particular plan’s network should be an important factor in your choice.
Head to the Find a Medicare plan page at medicare.gov where the compare feature allows you to look at plans side by side. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), an insurance rating organization, also compares what consumers think of Medicare Advantage plan’s services and physicians, and whether the plans meet certain quality standards. Top ratings in 2019 were garnered by an impressive 43 Aetna Medicare Advantage plans sold in 37 states plus the District of Columbia. Other companies with highly-rated Medicare Advantage plans included: Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Humana, Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, and United Healthcare. Be sure to check the ratings for plans available in your state.
What to Consider in Making Your Choice
Your lifestyle, health condition, and finances may all influence whether traditional Medicare plus Medigap or Medicare Advantage is best for you. Here are some things to consider:
The Costs
Medicare Advantage plans might save you money, but be sure to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll need to buy a separate Part D plan if you want that coverage. Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and whether there are any limits in their coverage. If extra benefits are included, such as help with hearing aids and dental bills, be sure to find out how much of these expenses will actually be covered.
Compare these costs to those of purchasing Medigap and stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies. Calculate the premiums, as well as the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance) the policies may require. Yes, these can be complex calculations, but an insurance broker can help by doing the math for you and making cost-saving recommendations.
Choice of Doctors
Traditional Medicare allows you to use any U.S. doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare, and most do. Most Medicare Advantage plans restrict you to using physicians in their network and may cover less, or none, of the expenses of using out-of-network and out-of-town providers.
A plus of Medicare Advantage managed care plans is that care is coordinated and your primary care doctor will be in the loop about the findings of specialists. With traditional Medicare you don’t need a referral to see a specialist or a prior authorization for procedures, but you’ll need to make sure care is coordinated and your doctors are in communication with one another. Often this is best done by developing a relationship with a primary care physician and letting them refer you to specialists.
Local Conditions and Convenience
In some areas where physicians and hospitals are scarce, it’s important to check out both the networks of available Medicare Advantage plans and the locations of providers who accept regular Medicare. Are the doctors accepting new patients? Will you have to travel far to see a provider or be treated at an emergency room? Advice from local professionals, neighbors, and licensed insurance brokers can help you find Medicare Advantage plans that do business in your area. Compare plans to find one that may suit your needs.
Lifestyle Factors
Frequent travel, dual residences, and currently having physicians whom you would like to keep are some of the factors that may make regular Medicare a good choice. Ask your current physicians if they participate in any Medicare Advantage plans and/or accept regular Medicare. For frequent fliers, choosing regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance policy that covers emergency care in foreign countries may be a good bet. Similarly, people who spend part of the year in a different geographical area may find it difficult to stay in network for medical care and might be better off with regular Medicare and a Medigap insurance policy.
Your Health
People with chronic diseases and those who develop a serious health condition should look deeper into the choices available. A Medicare Advantage plan may be a better choice if it has an out-of-pocket maximum that protects you from huge bills. Regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance plan generally allows you more choice in where you receive your care. Check whether any expensive drugs or equipment (such as supplies for people with diabetes) will be covered by your Medicare prescription drug plan, whether it's a stand-alone one or part of a Medicare Advantage plan.
Broader Benefits
Medicare Advantage plans are in the throes of change as the government allows insurers to add coverage for items that are not included in regular Medicare. These include such things as supplying food for service animals; paying for ramps for wheelchairs, hold bars, and indoor air quality monitors; adult day care; and residential and in-home respite care. Many of these benefits are just being initiated, so it pays to reconsider your choice of regular Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage each year during open enrollment to make sure you’re getting the benefits you need most, whether it's home care or transportation to doctors.
Can You Switch? Yes, But There’s a Catch
It’s logical to consider enjoying the cost savings of a Medicare Advantage plan while you’re relatively healthy, and then switching back to regular Medicare if you develop a condition you want treated at an out-of-town facility. In fact, switching between the two forms of Medicare (or between Medicare Advantage plans) is an option for everyone during the open enrollment period in the fall. This Annual Election Period runs from October 15 - December 7 each year.
Here’s the catch. If you switch back to regular Medicare (Part A and Part B), you may not be able to sign up for a Medigap insurance policy. When you first sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B, Medigap insurance companies are generally obligated to sell you a policy, regardless of your medical condition. But in subsequent years they may have the right to charge you extra due to your age and preexisting conditions, or not to sell you a policy at all if you have serious medical problems. Some states have enacted laws to address this. In New York and Connecticut, for example, Medigap insurance plans are guaranteed-issue year-round, while California, Massachusetts, Maine, Missouri, and Oregon have all set aside annual periods in which switching is allowed. If you live in a state that doesn't have this protection, planning to switch between the systems depending on your health condition is a risky business.
The CARES Act of 2020
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package, called the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act, into law. It expands Medicare's ability to cover treatment and services for those affected by COVID-19. The CARES Act also:
- Increases flexibility for Medicare to cover telehealth services.
- Authorizes Medicare certification for home health services by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse specialists.
- Increases Medicare payments for COVID-19-related hospital stays and durable medical equipment.
For Medicaid, the CARES Act clarifies that non-expansion states can use the Medicaid program to cover COVID-19-related services for uninsured adults who would have qualified for Medicaid if the state had chosen to expand. Other populations with limited Medicaid coverage are also eligible for coverage under this state option.",medicare supplement plans,9

Medicare is an extremely valuable healthcare resource for many seniors. However, Medicare alone does not cover all of the healthcare costs one is likely to face later in life. And since unexpected medical expenses can lead to stress and financial strain, many seniors prefer to be prepared for what might lay ahead.
Medicare Supplement Insurance is one way seniors can plan ahead for these unexpected costs. Customers pay a monthly premium for insurance that lowers or totally covers the out of pocket costs for expenses such as deductibles, copays, hospital stays, and doctor’s appointments. Some plans offer more extensive benefits for expenses such as international healthcare and skilled nursing facilities. There are numerous different plans available to accommodate people who desire different levels of coverage. And while having so many options makes it easy to get the right level of coverage, it can be overwhelming to sort through all of the companies that offer Medicare Supplement plans to find the right one for you.
To help make this decision easier, we’ve created a guide that profiles the best Medicare Supplement companies across the United States. You’ll find details about available plans, pricing models, customer service practices, and additional benefits. As you shop, this guide will help you understand which policies are best for you and help you narrow down your options. If you aren’t sure that Medicare Supplement Insurance is something you need, see our buyer’s guide at the bottom of the page for more insight.
Since it’s a type of insurance, descriptions of Medicare Supplement policies often contain terminology and stipulations that can be confusing to many shoppers. We’ve included this section to help you understand exactly what each plan and company is offering.
Eligibility: Medicare Supplement Insurance can only be purchased by people who are covered by Original Medicare: Parts A and B. Seniors with Part C, or Medicare Advantage, can not purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Insurance is Private: While Medicare is a federal program, it’s important to realize that Medicare Supplement policies are provided to consumers by private insurance companies and not the government. However, both the federal and state governments regulate the plans that are offered. Each insurance company has the ability to decide which plans it wants to offer.
Standardized Plans: All of the plans available are standardized and will offer the same basic benefits, but some companies may offer extra benefits in addition to what is required. Currently, the available plans include A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N. So while factors like the cost of a plan may vary, Plan A from one company must cover the exact same things as Plan A from any other company. Only Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have standardized plans differing from the rest of the country.
Due to new regulations, Plans C and F will not be offered to new Medicare enrollees after January 2020. However, anyone who already has Plans C or F will be able to keep their coverage, and anyone who was eligible for Medicare before January 2020 may still be able to choose Plan C or F.
Medigap: As you shop for Medicare Supplement plans, you’ll likely see companies use the term “Medigap.” Medigap is simply another popular term for Medicare Supplement Insurance. Some websites may also use the abbreviation MSI.
Plan Types: Some plans are available in high-deductible, select, and innovative options. The government does not require companies to offer these options.
Prescription Medications: Medicare Supplement plans do not cover prescription medication. However, customers who want this coverage can add on Medicare Part D, which is offered by many companies who provide Medicare Supplement plans.
Pricing Structures: When shopping for Medicare Supplement Insurance, you’ll likely encounter three different pricing structures that affect how much your policy costs. The pricing structure that is used will be determined by the company issuing the policy as well as state laws. These pricing structures are:
The world of insurance is large and there are hundreds of companies across the country offering Medicare Supplement plans. So to narrow it down and choose the best companies in the industry, we took the following factors into consideration:
Variety of Plans Offered
While there are countless companies offering Medicare Supplement Insurance, many only offer a couple of policies out of the 10 available. We focused our search on companies that are able to provide a majority of the available plans. These companies give potential customers the greatest amount of options to select a plan that fits their needs.
Number of States Served
There are many insurance companies around the country that only offer Medicare Supplement Insurance in a handful of states. While it’s difficult to find true nationwide coverage, the companies featured on our list are able to serve a majority of the country. However, not all plans will be offered in all places.
Company Integrity
When purchasing something as important as health insurance, it’s vital to select a provider you can trust. Because of this, we focused our search on companies that are widely regarded as trustworthy and have a long history of providing customers with insurance services. To determine this, we looked at factors like awards won, Better Business Bureau ratings, and customer reviews.

If you do choose to purchase coverage from Aetna, you’ll have access to a convenient customer online portal. On the website, you’ll be able to track your claims, view policy information, make payments, and request a replacement ID card.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
The majority of states utilize an attained-age pricing structure, but Medicare Supplement Insurance laws vary from state-to-state, others may use community-rated or issue-age-rated structures. Because of this, the prices for available plans will vary. Regardless of where you live, Aetna offers a 12-month rate lock, guaranteeing that premiums will not go up in the first year of coverage. You can get pricing estimates by providing state, ZIP code, date of birth, gender and plan start date.
Aetna does offer a 12% household discount for customers who are living with at least one other senior with Aetna Medicare Supplement Insurance. The company also offers a 30-day “Free Look” period, which allows you to cancel for any reason within the first 30 days and receive a full refund.

In addition to offering Medicare Supplement Insurance, Cigna has a proven record of going above and beyond for its customers. The company is dedicated to helping people improve their health and overall well-being, so it includes access to a number of programs and benefits for all customers. The competitive premiums plus the additional benefits make Cigna an excellent overall value.
Coverage
Cigna offers plans A, B, C, D, F, High-Deductible F, G, and N. Coverage is available in all 50 states, but not all plans will be available in all locations because of state laws. The insurance may be provided by any one of a number of Cigna family companies, such as American Retirement Life Insurance, depending on the customer’s location. Customers are able to research and purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance directly on Cigna’s website, but can also reach an agent over the phone to discuss plans.
Cigna’s Medicare Supplement plans do not require customers to use an in-network doctor, so seniors are free to use any healthcare provider who accepts Medicare. The plans provide free access to the Cigna Healthy rewards program, which provides savings on certain wellness products, weight-loss programs, and massage therapy.
The company is also able to offer supplement insurance options that fall outside of the traditional and regulated Medicare Supplement plans. These options include coverage for cancer treatments, accident expenses, heart attacks, and strokes. Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D are also available.
Cigna customers have access to United States-based customer service.

Most Experience Working with Seniors
AARP is a special interest group that has served seniors since 1958. The company was founded with the goal of keeping aging Americans informed, empowered, and independent. Through various programs and services, it works to make the world more accessible and enjoyable for seniors across the country.
AARP is not an insurance company itself, but it does frequently team up with insurance providers to bring seniors affordable and accessible insurance solutions. To provide Medicare Supplement plans, it has teamed up with United Healthcare, an experienced nationwide health insurance company.
Coverage
AARP offers plans A, B, C, F, G, K, L, and N. Plans are available in all 50 states, but the plans that are available will vary by location. Customers only need to enter their zip code to see an estimate for a Medicare Supplement plan with AARP. The website will then display all of the plans available in your area. The premium estimates displayed assume that you are turning 65 and do not use tobacco products, so your actual premium may vary depending on your age and habits. Alternatively, customers can contact an agent to discuss their options over the phone.
Customers will also have the option to purchase Medicare Part D directly through United Healthcare when they sign up for a Medicare Supplement plan if they wish to have coverage for prescription medications.
To qualify for coverage, you must be an AARP member, which comes with an annual fee of $16. The company makes it easy for customers to join AARP at the same time they sign up for Medicare Supplement Insurance. Membership includes access to a lot of extra benefits such as discounted movie tickets, car rentals, hotels, and more.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
AARP generally uses community-rated pricing, which means that a 66-year-old woman in a given area would pay the same amount as a 76-year-old living in the same area. However, since most seniors will get a discount when they enroll at age 65 and the discount decreases every following year, the pricing model ends up being similar to age-attained.
The company offers an enrollment discount in most states of up to 30% for seniors aged 65. The enrollment discount amount decreases by 3% with each year that passes. It also offers a 5% household discount in most states when more than one person in the household is enrolled in one of the available Medicare Supplement Insurance plans through AARP.
The following pricing samples are based on information for a female non-smoker living in Denver, Colorado who is aging into Medicare. While this may not represent the pricing in your area, it can give you an idea of how much it costs to have Medicare Supplement Insurance coverage through AARP.

Best for Medicare Experience
Mutual of Omaha has been offering Medicare Supplement Insurance since Medicare’s inception in 1966, making it one of the most experienced companies when it comes to navigating the Medicare system. The company has a great reputation for offering quality health insurance products across the country.
Owned by its policyholders, Mutual of Omaha also has a reputation for being a company that cares about its customers. The company values excellent service, stating that 98% of all Medicare claims are paid out within 12 hours. The genuine concern for the well-being of its customers combined with its long experience with Medicare makes Mutual of Omaha an excellent choice for Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Coverage
Mutual of Omaha offers plans A, F, HD-F, G, and N. Coverage is available nationwide, although not all plans will be available in all states. It also offers Medicare Part D, making it easy for customers to get coverage for prescription drugs as well. The company has several subsidiary companies, so depending on where a customer lives, policies might be issued by a company of a different name such as United of Omaha.
Getting a quote through the website requires customers to fill out a form with contact information and location. A licensed agent will then reach out to discuss the various options available. For this reason, it’s not a great choice for anyone looking to handle their insurance entirely online.
Policyholders have access to a customer account on the company website which makes it easy to track claims, find policy information, and make payments. The web portal is also host to a library of helpful information, allowing customers to easily find answers to frequently asked questions about coverage and healthcare.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
It’s difficult to obtain pricing quotes from Mutual of Omaha online. Since laws vary from place to place, the company prefers to have agents reach out to potential customers so they can get the information that’s relevant to them. That being said, Mutual of Omaha typically uses attained-age rated pricing where it’s allowed. With attained-age rated pricing, premiums will increase as customers age, so it’s a good idea to compare quotes from various birth years in your area to see how they might increase as you get older.
Mutual of Omaha does offer a household discount of up to 12% for spouses who both have coverage through the company. You can also access the discount if you’ve been living with another individual over the age of 60 for at least one year and that person also has coverage through Mutual of Omaha.
Mutual of Omaha doesn’t offer simplified quotes on its website. In order to learn more about your options and obtain pricing information, you can fill out a contact form and have an agent contact you. Alternatively, you reach out to the company directly by calling 800-205-8193.
Best for Local and In-Person Service
While best known for its catchy car insurance advertisements, State Farm has a wealth of experience providing Medicare Supplement Insurance across the country.
Like most companies, State Farm does offer a tool to get quotes online. However, the company is unique in the way it uses a network of local agents to help customers select plans. There are State Farm offices located throughout the country, and customers are encouraged to use their local agent as a resource for knowledge and assistance. This makes State Farm an excellent choice for customers who prefer the personal touch of local relationships.
Coverage
State Farm currently offers plans A, C, D, F, G, and N. Coverage in 46 states, but not all plans will be available in all states. The company makes it easy to see which plans are available in every location with a simple online tool. Seniors who are interested in purchasing a plan through State Farm only need to fill out a simple form with some basic information to see which options are available to them. The website itself is easy to navigate, and State Farm does a great job of clarifying commonly asked questions throughout the process.
The company does not currently offer vision, dental, or prescription drug plans. So if customers want this type of coverage, they’ll have to find an alternate provider. However, State Farm does offer a variety of other insurance services, which can be helpful if customers are seeking a single provider for things like auto insurance and home insurance in addition to their Medicare Supplement Insurance.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
State Farm’s pricing models vary from place to place, but the company typically uses the attained-age pricing model where it can. This means that prices will increase as you age.
To get a quote, you’ll need to fill out a small form with your basic information. If you want to continue with the process after getting your initial quote, you’ll fill out a contact form and an agent from State Farm will get in touch with you to continue the process. Alternatively, you can find an agent in your area and go through the entire process with them, which is an excellent option for anyone who prefers in-person contacts.
If customers choose to purchase other types of insurance through State Farm, such as auto insurance or property insurance, they may be eligible for a bundle discount. The specific amount will vary depending on what policies are purchased, but it can lead to generous savings on monthly premiums.

Best for Budget-Conscious Seniors
Founded in 1992, Anthem has become one of the largest insurance companies in the United States. With one in eight Americans currently holding a policy with Anthem, the company has a reputation for providing an outstanding selection of coverage options at competitive rates.
Anthem Blue Cross offers Medicare Supplement plans at rates that can be significantly lower than the competition. And since plans are closely regulated by state and federal government, customers still have the peace of mind knowing that they have the coverage they need. Combined with a selection of generous discounts, Anthem is an excellent choice for budget-conscious seniors.
Coverage
Anthem currently offers plans A, N, G, and F in 14 states across the country (CA, CO, CT, GA, IN, KY, ME, MO, NH, NV, NY, OH, VA and WI). While Anthem’s coverage is limited to 14 states, it is part of the wider Blue Cross Blue Shield network. This means that if Anthem doesn’t provide coverage in your state, you’ll be directed to a list of companies connected with Blue Cross Blue Shield that do.
Anthem’s website is easy to navigate, and potential customers should find it simple to see exactly what’s available in their area and to obtain a quote. It’s also easy to get in touch with an agent who can provide seniors with more detailed information or walk them through the entire sign up process.
The company also offers Medicare Part D, making it a good choice for seniors who are looking for prescription drug coverage. Additionally, customers will find it easy to bundle their Medicare Supplement Insurance with the company’s vision and dental plans.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
Anthem generally uses the attained-age pricing structure, meaning that premiums will increase as the policyholder ages. However, factors such as gender, location, and tobacco use will affect pricing as well.
Anthem’s price comparison tool makes it easy to compare costs on Medicare Supplement Insurance, Medicare Advantage, and a prescription drug plan. The company also offers dental and vision coverage.
Anthem offers a 5% household discount in most states, meaning that if more than one person in a household is enrolled in a Medicare Supplemental Insurance plan through Anthem, each enrolled individual gets the discount. The company also offers small discounts for enrolling in its monthly electronic payments or for paying for an entire year up-front.
While online quotes are not available in all states, we looked at pricing for a non-smoking female living in Hartford, Connecticut who is aging into Medicare. If online quotes are not available in your region, the website will direct you to contact an agent who can help you further.

Coverage

Because ManhattanLife is part of a group, other companies within the group may be able to provide coverage where ManhattanLife can not.
While ManhattanLife does offer some optional coverage selections such as vision and dental, it does not offer Medicare Part D, so customers looking for prescription medication coverage will need to do so with a separate provider.
The company’s website is intuitive to navigate and easy to use. It is very transparent with visitors in describing what each plan contains and what is available in each location, so potential customers won’t need to waste their time trying to figure out if this is the best company for them.

Best for Coverage in Specialized States
Founded in 1904, Transamerica has evolved into one of the most trusted financial and insurance companies in the country. It has always been invested in protecting not only the financial well being of its customers, but also their physical health and emotional well being. The company prides itself on providing outstanding services and always puts the customer first. It currently holds an A+ (Superior) rating with A.M. Best.
The company offers true nationwide coverage, with plans available in all 50 states. This includes Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, which have specialized Medicare laws. Because of the specialized laws in these states that cause supplement plans to deviate from the common letter plan format, many companies don’t offer plans there. But residents of these states can rest assured that they can find coverage with a reliable, trustworthy company in Transamerica.
Coverage
Transamerica currently offers plans A, F, G, K, and N. Coverage is available in all 50 states and specialized plans are available in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Not all plans will be available in all states.
Transamerica’s plans allow customers to use any doctor across the country that accepts Medicare; there are no network restrictions on any of its plans. While the company does not offer Medicare Part D, it does offer an extensive selection of other insurance and financial planning services including life insurance and retirement planning. This makes Transamerica a good choice for seniors who are also interested in bundling their insurance with other financial planning products.
Pricing Structure and Available Discounts
Transamerica does not offer any pricing information on its website. In order to get a quote, interested customers need to call and speak directly to an agent. The agent will ask for details about age, location, gender, tobacco use, and coverage start date. More information might be needed to obtain a quote depending on what state the customer lives in, but most people can expect competitive premiums on an attained-age pricing structure.
With Transamerica, discounts will vary depending on location. In many states, customers can get a small discount for enrolling in automatic online payments.
Finding the right Medicare Supplement Insurance provider can be an overwhelming task. There are many different companies offering a wide selection of supplement plans, along with other additional policies. In this buyer’s guide, we’ll walk you through a few simple steps that can help you determine if you need Medicare Supplement Insurance and help you find the company that’s right for you.
Step 1: Determine your Eligibility and if Medicare Supplement Insurance is Right for You
In order to be eligible for a Medicare Supplement plan, you’ll need to have Original Medicare, which is Parts A and B. If you have Medicare Advantage you can not purchase these plans unless you are switching to Original Medicare.
A supplemental insurance plan may be right for you if you wish to add additional coverage that can protect you from unexpected medical expenses in the future. While this means you’ll need to budget for an additional monthly premium, it also means expenses like copayments and deductibles will be covered. Since medical expenses can put a significant strain on your budget, especially if they aren’t planned for, this coverage can provide peace of mind over all of the gaps in Medicare coverage.
Step 2: Understand Your Needs
Once you know that Medicare Supplement Insurance is for you, your next step is to understand your coverage needs. This will depend on several factors, including your current health and financial situation.
For people who are in relatively good health and don’t anticipate needing extensive medical care, plans A, K, and L might be all you need. Since these provide basic coverage, the premiums on these plans tend to be the lowest you can find. C, G, and F fall at the other end of the spectrum with full coverage and generally high premiums. The official U.S. Government website for Medicare provides a detailed chart that can help you understand exactly what each supplement plan covers.
If you are looking for lower premiums, you’ll also want to keep Select plans in mind. These plans offer lower monthly premiums, but you’ll only be able to choose providers from a small, preapproved list.
Step 3: Consider Additional Services and Benefits
If you’re shopping solely for a Medicare Supplement plan, additional services and member benefits may not impact your decisions. But it’s worth considering what other services you might need or could benefit from going forward.
You’ll find that many companies offer Medicare Part D, which is essential if you’re looking for prescription drug coverage. You may also wish to find a company that offers vision, dental, and hearing insurance options so you do not have to go through multiple companies.
Many companies also offer other insurance services such as life, property, home, and auto. If these are insurance services that you need, you might find it convenient to use the same company. You may also be able to get a bundle discount if you hold multiple policies with a single company.
Additionally, some companies offer customers member benefits. These benefits vary from company to company but can include discounts on glasses, wellness products, gym memberships, and travel expenses. Several companies also offer wellness coaching and access to a nurse for health advice.
Step 4: Compare Companies and Gather Quotes
Now that you know what you need, you can narrow your search down to companies that offer what you’re looking for. You should get quotes from at least 3 different companies before making a decision because prices can vary significantly. While many companies offer quotes online, calling an agent can clear up confusion and be a great way to test whether or not you like working with the people at the company.
While comparing quotes, you should also ask about available discounts. Many companies do not advertise discounts directly on their website but will grant them to customers who live in eligible locations when asked. Some common discounts include a household discount when more than one person gets coverage through the company, no tobacco use discounts, automatic payment discounts, annual payment discounts, and new enrollment discounts.
This is also a good time to evaluate the kind of service the company provides. Some companies provide access to local agents, while others are entirely online and over-the-phone operations. You should spend some time on the company’s website to see if you’re comfortable using it as well, since there’s a good chance you’ll be visiting it often to track claims and make payments.
Step 5: Sign Up for Your Chosen Plans During Open Enrollment
It’s important to sign up for your Medicare Supplement plans during your open enrollment period, which is the 6-month period following your 65th birthday. This not only helps to keep your costs as low as possible, but it protects you from being denied coverage for preexisting health conditions.
Each Medicare Supplement plan is standardized, meaning that it must conform with both federal and state laws. These laws are in place to protect customers, and each plan must offer the same basic benefits. You’ll find that some policies may offer additional benefits, allowing you to choose a plan that better meets your individual needs.
While each insurance company decides which supplement plans it wants to offer, state laws may affect what is offered in your area. Insurance companies do not need to offer every policy, but the federal government requires all companies offering Medicare Supplement plans to offer Plan A.
The chart below will give you a quick overview of exactly what each nationwide plan covers.
A note on plans C & F: Beginning on January 1, 2020, plans C & F will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare. However, if you already have either plan your coverage will continue as normal. Additionally, if you were eligible for Medicare before this date but not enrolled yet, you may still be able to access one of these plans.
In the following section you’ll find a brief overview of each Medicare Supplement Plan.
Plan A
Since the federal government requires all insurance companies to offer Plan A if they sell supplemental policies, it’s the most common and generally has the lowest premiums.
Plan A includes coverage for:
Plan B
Plan B is nearly identical to Plan A, but it also includes coverage for Part A deductibles.
Plan C
Plan C includes coverage for a number of additional expenses, including:
As of January 1, 2020, Plan C will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare.
Plan D
Plan D is nearly identical to Plan C, but it does not cover Part B deductibles. Since Plan C is being phased out in 2020, it’s an ideal alternative if you’re seeking that level of coverage.
Plan F
Plan F is considered a “full coverage” plan. It includes:
As of January 1, 2020, Plan F will no longer be available to anyone who is new to Medicare.
Plan G
Plan G is nearly identical to Plan F, but it does not cover Part B deductibles. Since Plan F is being phased out in 2020, Plan G is an ideal alternative for anyone seeking a “full coverage” plan.
Plan K
Plan K is a low coverage with less expensive premiums. It fully covers Part A coinsurance & hospital costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits stop, as well as 50% of the following costs:
Starting in 2020, Plan K will have an out-of-pocket spending limit of $5,880. Once you’ve reached this amount, your plan will cover 100% of your eligible expenses.
Plan L
Plan L is similar to Plan K, but it offers slightly more coverage. It fully covers Part A coinsurance and hospital costs up to 365 days after medicare benefits stop. It also covers 75% of the following costs:
Starting in 2020, Plan L will have an out-of-pocket spending limit of $2,940. Once you’ve reached this amount, your plan will cover 100% of your eligible expenses.
Plan M
Plan M is a medium-coverage plan that includes the following:
Plan N
Plan N is similar to Plan M, with a few minor differences. In this plan, you’ll have coverage for:
If you live in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, or Minnesota, you’ll find that Medicare Supplement Insurance is standardized in different ways. Each state has its own requirements that differ from the letter plans more commonly used across the country and use their own list of Basic Benefits that each plan must cover.
In Massachusetts, Basic Benefits include:
There are two supplement plans available in the state: the Core Plan and Supplement Plan 1.
For a quick side-by-side overview of the plans available in Massachusetts, refer to the table below.

When should I purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance?
You’ll want to purchase your Medicare Supplement Insurance during the open enrollment period. Open enrollment is the 6-month period following your 65th birthday. During this timeframe, you’ll be able to enroll in any plan, regardless of any preexisting conditions. If you wait until after this period ends to purchase coverage, you may be faced with higher premiums and companies can deny you coverage.
How much does Medicare Supplement Insurance cost?
Medicare Supplement Insurance prices vary widely from place to place. Other factors like gender, level of coverage, age, and tobacco use can also affect the total cost of a plan. Because of this, there is no one number that accurately estimates the cost. You may be able to find plans that cost less than $100 per month if you’re in search of basic coverage, but you may also encounter plans that cost close to $1,000 or more if you’re looking for maximum protection. This is why it’s important to get quotes from a variety of companies before making a decision.
Am I required to purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance?
No, no one is required to purchase any Medicare Supplement Insurance plans. However, it’s important to keep in mind that Medicare does not cover 100% of your healthcare costs. Even if you’re in relatively good health now, there’s no knowing what will happen in the future, and out-of-pocket medical expenses can quickly become a serious financial strain. Because of this, some form of coverage is recommended.
Are there any savings available for Medicare Supplement Insurance?
Yes, there are various discounts offered by companies that provide Medicare Supplement Insurance. The most common discount is for non-smokers, since people who don’t use tobacco tend to have fewer health problems. Household discounts are also popular, giving people a percentage off of their monthly premiums if they live with another senior who has coverage through the same company. As you shop, you may also find that some companies offer discounts for paying annually or setting up automatic monthly payments.
Where can I go for more information?If you need more assistance or information regarding Medicare, there are a number of different sources available. Medicare.gov is a website managed by the federal government and is an excellent source of information regarding Medicare and Medicare Supplement Insurance. There, you can find forms, resources, compare plans, and find local sources of assistance. Alternatively, you can visit your state’s government website to find more information and locate resources that are close to you.",medicare supplement plans,10

Medigap policies are standardized
Every Medigap policy must follow federal and state laws designed to protect you, and it must be clearly identified as ""Medicare Supplement Insurance."" Insurance companies can sell you only a ""standardized"" policy identified in most states by letters.
All policies offer the same basic Benefits [Glossary]
but some offer additional benefits, so you can choose which one meets your needs. In Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, Medigap policies are standardized in a different way.
Each insurance company decides which Medigap policies it wants to sell, although state laws might affect which ones they offer. Insurance companies that sell Medigap policies:
- Don't have to offer every Medigap plan
- Must offer Medigap Plan A if they offer any Medigap policy
- Must also offer Plan C or Plan F if they offer any plan
Note
As of January 1, 2020, Medigap plans sold to new people with Medicare aren't allowed to cover the Part B deductible. Because of this, Plans C and F are not available to people new to Medicare starting on January 1, 2020. If you already have either of these 2 plans (or the high deductible version of Plan F) or are covered by one of these plans before January 1, 2020, you’ll be able to keep your plan. If you were eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, but not yet enrolled, you may be able to buy one of these plans.
Medigap Plans
Compare Medigap plans side-by-side
The chart below shows basic information about the different benefits Medigap policies cover.
Yes = the plan covers 100% of this benefit
No = the policy doesn't cover that benefit
% = the plan covers that percentage of this benefit
N/A = not applicable
* Plans F and G also offer a high-deductible plan in some states. With this option, you must pay for Medicare-covered costs (coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles) up to the deductible amount of $2,340 in 2020 before your policy pays anything. (Plans C and F aren't available to people who are newly eligible for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020.)
** For Plans K and L, after you meet your out-of-pocket yearly limit and your yearly Part B deductible ($198 in 2020), the Medigap plan pays 100% of covered services for the rest of the calendar year.
*** Plan N pays 100% of the Part B coinsurance, except for a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to a $50 copayment for emergency room visits that don't result in inpatient admission.

Do you have fairly frequent doctor or hospital visits? If so, you may already know that Medicare Part A and Part B come with out-of-pocket costs you have to pay. You might be able to save money with a Medicare Supplement insurance plan. Medicare Supplement, or Medigap, insurance plans fill in “gaps” in basic benefits left behind by Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.
In 47 states, there are up to 10 standardized Medicare Supplement insurance plans that are denoted by the letters A through N (plans E, H, I, and J are no longer sold). The private insurance companies offering these plans do not have to offer every Medicare Supplement plan, but they must offer at least Plan A.
Please note that although the names may sound similar, the “parts” of Medicare, such as Part A and Part B, are not the same as Medigap Plan A, Plan B, etc.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan basic benefits
Each Medicare Supplement insurance plan offers a different level of basic benefits, but each lettered plan must include the same standardized basic benefits regardless of insurance company and location. For example, Medicare Supplement Plan G in Florida includes the same basic benefits as Plan G in North Dakota. Please note that if you live in Massachusetts, Minnesota, or Wisconsin, your Medicare Supplement insurance plan options are different than in the rest of the country. Medicare Supplement insurance plans do not have to cover vision, dental, long-term care, or hearing aids, but all plans must cover at least a portion of the following basic benefits:
- Medicare Part A coinsurance costs up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are exhausted
- Medicare Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayments
- Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayments
- First three pints of blood used in a medical procedure
Some plans include additional basic benefits. For example, Medicare Supplement Plan F*, the most comprehensive standardized Medigap insurance plan, carries the following additional benefits:
- Medicare Part A deductible
- Medicare Part B deductible*
- Part B excess charges
- Part B preventive care coinsurance
- Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) care coinsurance
- Foreign travel emergency care (80% of Medicare-approved costs, up to plan limits)
Some plans may include additional innovative benefits.
*Medicare Supplement plans that may cover the Medicare Part B deductible – Medicare Supplement Plans C and F – will be phased out. If you’re not eligible for Medicare until January 1, 2020 or later, you won’t be able to buy Plan C or Plan F. You won’t generally have to give up your Plan C or Plan F if you already have one. If you’re eligible for Medicare before January 1, 2020, you might be able to buy Plan C or Plan F.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan costs
Although private insurance companies are required to offer the same basic benefits for each lettered plan, they do have the ability to charge different premiums. You might want to shop around to find a Medicare Supplement insurance plan that may fit your medical and financial needs. Insurance companies may price their plan premiums in any of the following ways:
- Community no-age-rated: These Medicare Supplement insurance plans charge premiums that are the same across the board, regardless of age.
- Issue-age-rated: These plans base their premiums on your age when you first enrolled in the policy. Therefore, the younger you are when you enroll in this type of plan, the lower your premium will be.
- Attained-age-rated: Like issue-age-rated, these plans base their premiums on the age you were when you first bought a policy, but unlike issue-age-rated, premiums increase as you get older.
Please note that no matter what rating method an insurance company uses, premiums may increase over time for reasons other than age, such as inflation.
Medicare Supplement insurance plan enrollment and eligibility
To be eligible to enroll in a Medicare Supplement insurance plan, you must be enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B. A good time to enroll in a plan is generally during the Medigap Open Enrollment Period, which begins on the first day of the month that you are both age 65 or older and enrolled in Part B, and lasts for six months. During this period, you have a guaranteed-issue right to join any Medicare Supplement insurance plan available where you live. You may not be denied basic benefits based on any pre-existing conditions** during this enrollment period (although a waiting period may apply). If you miss this enrollment period and attempt to enroll in the future, you may be denied basic benefits or charged a higher premium based on your medical history. In some states, you may be able to enroll in a Medigap plan before the age of 65.
**Pre-existing conditions are generally health conditions that existed before the start of a policy. They may limit coverage, be excluded from coverage, or even prevent you from being approved for a policy; however, the exact definition and relevant limitations or exclusions of coverage will vary with each plan, so check a specific plan’s official plan documents to understand how that plan handles pre-existing conditions

Medicare Supplement (also known as Medigap or MedSupp) insurance plans help cover certain out-of-pocket costs that Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, doesn’t cover. There are 10 plan types available in most states, and each plan is labeled with a different letter that corresponds with a certain level of basic benefits.
In most states, Medigap insurance plans have the same standardized benefits for each letter category. This means that the basic benefits for a Plan A, for example, is the same across every insurance company that sells Plan A, regardless of location. This makes it easy to compare Medicare Supplement insurance plans because the main difference between plans of the same letter category will be the premium cost.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin standardize their Medicare Supplement insurance plans differently from the rest of the country. In all states, insurance companies that sell Medicare Supplement insurance aren’t required to offer all plan types. However, any insurance company that sells Medigap insurance is required by law to offer Medigap Plan A. If an insurance company wants to offer other Medigap plans, it must sell either Plan C or Plan F in addition to any other plans it would like to sell.
The chart below allows you to compare Medicare Supplement insurance plans based on what’s offered across the standardized plans that are available in most states.
* There is also a high-deductible version of Plan F where beneficiaries pay a deductible of $2,300 in 2019 before the Medigap plan begins to cover Medicare-covered costs.
An important note about Medicare Supplement Plans F and C: You may not be able to buy these plans if you qualify for Medicare on or after January 1, 2020. That includes high-deductible Plan F. If you already have one of these plans, you won’t have to give it up.
You might be able to get a high-deductible Medicare Supplement Plan G in 2020, according to America’s Health Insurance Plans (ahip.org). It doesn’t pay for the Medicare Part B deductible.
** After the out-of-pocket limit (including the Medicare Part B deductible) is reached for Plans K or L, the Medigap plan pays 100% of Medicare-covered services for the remainder of the calendar year.
***Plan N pays 100% of the Medicare Part B coinsurance costs, with the exception of a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to $50 for emergency room visits that don’t result in the beneficiary being admitted as an inpatient.
****Medically Necessary Emergency Care in a Foreign Country: coverage to the extent not covered by Medicare for 80 percent of the billed charges for Medicare-eligible expenses for medically necessary emergency hospital, physician and medical care received in a foreign country, which care would have been covered by Medicare if provided in the United States and which care began during the first 60 consecutive days of each trip outside the United States, subject to a calendar year deductible of $250, and a lifetime maximum benefit of $50,000. For purposes of this benefit, “emergency care” shall mean care needed immediately because of an injury or an illness of sudden and unexpected onset.

- Choosing a Medicare Advantage Plan
- What to Consider in Making Your Choice

- The CARES Act of 2020
Anyone who's ready to sign up for Medicare has a lot of decisions to make. But one decision is especially important: Should you choose Medicare Advantage or use Medigap to supplement your Original Medicare plan?
Key Takeaways
- Traditional Medicare provides good basic health coverage, but it pays only about 80% of approved costs for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures and usually doesn't cover prescription drug costs or such things as routine dental care.
- Medigap supplemental insurance plans are designed to fill Medicare Part A and Part B coverage gaps.
- To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance) within the seven-month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
- You can choose to get your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits through a Medicare Advantage plan. They often include benefits beyond Part A and Part B. Private, Medicare-approved health insurance companies offer these plans.
- Although Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is optional, if you don’t get it as either as a stand-alone plan or as part of a Medicare Advantage plan, there may be financial penalties if you need to buy a policy later on because you need expensive drugs.
- Consider plan costs, plan doctors, convenience, your lifestyle and travel plans, your health, and any additional benefits in making your Medicare coverage choices.
Medicare Coverage
Budgeting for healthcare costs in retirement is tough since there’s usually no way of knowing whether your expenses each year will be minimal or huge. While traditional Medicare (Part A and Part B) provides good basic coverage, it pays only about 80% of the costs it approves for hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. The other 20% of the bill is the individual’s responsibility and—unlike coverage under the Affordable Care Act—there is no cap on the amount a person might have to pay in one year.
Let's say, for example, that you need heart bypass surgery. The cost would be a minimum of $85,891, according to the American Heart Association , and you would be responsible for a co-pay of $17,178—or much more if there are complications or something else goes wrong. In addition, some health needs, such as prescription drugs, hearing aids, eyeglasses, and dental care, are not covered at all by regular Medicare (Part A and Part B).
There are two basic ways for recipients to fill most of these coverage gaps and reduce the risk of tremendous bills in a bad health year:
- Medicare Plus Medigap Supplemental Insurance Policies
- Medicare Advantage Plans
Medicare Plus Medigap Supplemental Insurance Policies
About two-thirds of the 61 million seniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries choose traditional Medicare, Parts A and B, which cover hospitals, doctors, and medical procedures. About 80% of these beneficiaries supplement their insurance with Medigap (Medicare Supplement) insurance, Medicaid, employer-sponsored insurance, and/or stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies.
Medicare Supplement insurance plans are not connected with or endorsed by the U.S. government or the federal Medicare program.
While this may be the more expensive option, it has a few advantages. Both Medicare and Medigap insurance plans cover you for any hospital or doctor in the U.S. that accepts Medicare, and the great majority do. There is no need for prior authorization or a referral from a primary care doctor. Coverage includes the entire U.S., which may be important for those who travel frequently or spend part of the year in a different locale. This option is also attractive to those who have particular physicians and hospitals they want to use.
Medicare Advantage Plans
Available from private, Medicare-approved insurance companies, Medicare Advantage policies (Part C) are marketed to consumers under such names as Aetna, Humana, and Kaiser Foundation Medicare plans. They may have no premium or a lower one compared to the significant premiums for Medigap and prescription drug insurance policies. Medicare Advantage plans cover hospitals and doctors and often also include prescription drug coverage and some services not covered by Medicare. A little more than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries choose one of these plans.
Most Medicare Advantage plans operate as health maintenance organization (HMO) or preferred provider organization (PPO) insurance. HMOs limit members to using the doctors and hospitals in their networks. PPOs generally let members get care outside the plan's network, but members may have to pay more for such care. Some plans require prior authorization for specialist care or procedures, and/or a referral from a primary care doctor. Plans might not cover care given outside of the network’s geographical area. Extra benefits not covered by regular Medicare, such as eyeglasses, routine dental care, or gym memberships, may be offered.
When to Sign Up for Medicare
As you approach age 65, it’s important to know which enrollment deadlines apply to your circumstances to avoid costly fines and gaps in coverage. Begin by checking on your eligibility. To avoid penalties and gaps in coverage, most people should sign up for Medicare Part A (hospitals) and Part B (doctors) in the seven month window that starts three months before the month you turn 65 to three months following your 65th birthday.
If you currently get Social Security, you will be automatically enrolled; if not, you need to sign up either online or at your Social Security office.
Medicare Part B
If you are working at age 65, however, and you have employer insurance through a company with more than 20 employees, you have the right to stay on your employer insurance and delay signing up for Medicare Part B until your employer coverage ends. If you work for an employer with fewer than 20 employees, it is very important to ask the employer whether you are required to sign up for Medicare and get that decision in writing.
Medicare Part D
You need to be signed up for Medicare Parts A and B before you can enroll in a Medicare Advantage (Part C) plan. Once you’ve enrolled in Medicare, a key decision point is choosing coverage for Part D prescription drug insurance. If you don’t enroll in Part D insurance when you start Medicare and want to buy drug coverage later on, you may be permanently penalized for signing up late.
You can avoid the penalty, however, if you have what's known as creditable prescription drug coverage, which is prescription drug coverage (from an employer or union, for example) that’s expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. If you have this kind of drug coverage when you become eligible for Medicare, you are generally allowed to keep it. You generally won't have to pay a penalty if you later decide to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and you haven't gone for longer than 63 continuous days without creditable coverage.
Many Medicare Advantage plans include Part D drug insurance, but a stand-alone policy can also be purchased for those who choose regular Medicare (Part A and Part B) or a Medicare Advantage plan that doesn’t include Part D.
Choosing Traditional Medicare Plus a Medigap Plan
Regular or traditional Medicare comprises Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance). You can supplement this coverage with a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan and a Medigap supplemental insurance plan. While signing up for Medicare gets you into Parts A and B, you have to take action on your own to buy these supplemental policies.
Finding Part D, Drug Insurance
To get started, find the plans available in your zip code. Once you have created an account at Medicare.gov, you can enter the names of your drugs and use a convenient tool that allows you to compare plan premiums, deductibles, and Medicare star ratings.
If you don’t take many (or any) prescription drugs, look for a plan with a low monthly premium. All plans must still cover most drugs used by people with Medicare. If, on the other hand, you have high prescription drug costs, check into plans that cover your drugs in the donut hole, the coverage gap period that kicks in after you and the plan have spent $4,020 on covered drugs in 2020.
Selecting a Medigap (supplemental) Plan: Recent Changes Limit Choices
Medigap policies are private plans, available from insurance companies or through brokers, but not on medicare.gov. They are labeled Plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, each with a different standardized coverage set. Some plans include emergency medical benefits during foreign travel. Since coverage is standard, there are no ratings of Medigap policies. Consumers can confidently compare insurer’s prices for each letter plan and simply choose the better deal.
As of Jan. 1, 2020, Medigap plans sold to new Medicare beneficiaries aren't allowed to cover the Part B deductible.
Until recently, most people (66%) who bought Medigap policies chose Plan F, which gave the most comprehensive coverage, including paying for the Medicare Part B deductible ($198 in 2020).12 However, in an effort to trim Medicare expenses, Congress suspended Plans C and F for people who become Medicare-eligible in 2020 and beyond.
Plan D and Plan G have similar benefits to Plan C and Plan F, except for not covering the Part B deductible. People who signed up or became eligible for Medicare before 2020 can purchase or continue Plans C or F, though prices may rise and it may be a better deal to switch to a plan that doesn’t cover the deductible.
Choosing a Medicare Advantage Plan
Medicare Advantage Health Plans are similar to private health insurance. Most services, such as office visits, lab work, surgery, and many others, are covered after a small co-pay. Plans might offer an HMO or PPO network and all plans place a yearly limit on total out-of-pocket expenses. Each plan has different benefits and rules. Most provide prescription drug coverage. Some require a referral to see a specialist while others won’t. Some may pay a portion of out-of-network care, while others will cover only doctors and facilities that are in the HMO or PPO network. There are also other types of Medicare Advantage plans.
Selecting a plan with a low or no annual premium can be important. But its also essential to check on co-pay and coinsurance costs, especially for expensive hospital stays and procedures, to estimate your possible annual expenses. Since care is often limited to in-network physicians and hospitals, the quality and size of a particular plan’s network should be an important factor in your choice.
Head to the Find a Medicare plan page at medicare.gov where the compare feature allows you to look at plans side by side. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), an insurance rating organization, also compares what consumers think of Medicare Advantage plan’s services and physicians, and whether the plans meet certain quality standards. Top ratings in 2019 were garnered by an impressive 43 Aetna Medicare Advantage plans sold in 37 states plus the District of Columbia. Other companies with highly-rated Medicare Advantage plans included: Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Humana, Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, and United Healthcare. Be sure to check the ratings for plans available in your state.
What to Consider in Making Your Choice
Your lifestyle, health condition, and finances may all influence whether traditional Medicare plus Medigap or Medicare Advantage is best for you. Here are some things to consider:
The Costs
Medicare Advantage plans might save you money, but be sure to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll need to buy a separate Part D plan if you want that coverage. Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and whether there are any limits in their coverage. If extra benefits are included, such as help with hearing aids and dental bills, be sure to find out how much of these expenses will actually be covered.
Compare these costs to those of purchasing Medigap and stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug policies. Calculate the premiums, as well as the amount of any out-of-pocket expenses (deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance) the policies may require. Yes, these can be complex calculations, but an insurance broker can help by doing the math for you and making cost-saving recommendations.
Choice of Doctors
Traditional Medicare allows you to use any U.S. doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare, and most do. Most Medicare Advantage plans restrict you to using physicians in their network and may cover less, or none, of the expenses of using out-of-network and out-of-town providers.
A plus of Medicare Advantage managed care plans is that care is coordinated and your primary care doctor will be in the loop about the findings of specialists. With traditional Medicare you don’t need a referral to see a specialist or a prior authorization for procedures, but you’ll need to make sure care is coordinated and your doctors are in communication with one another. Often this is best done by developing a relationship with a primary care physician and letting them refer you to specialists.
Local Conditions and Convenience
In some areas where physicians and hospitals are scarce, it’s important to check out both the networks of available Medicare Advantage plans and the locations of providers who accept regular Medicare. Are the doctors accepting new patients? Will you have to travel far to see a provider or be treated at an emergency room? Advice from local professionals, neighbors, and licensed insurance brokers can help you find Medicare Advantage plans that do business in your area. Compare plans to find one that may suit your needs.
Lifestyle Factors
Frequent travel, dual residences, and currently having physicians whom you would like to keep are some of the factors that may make regular Medicare a good choice. Ask your current physicians if they participate in any Medicare Advantage plans and/or accept regular Medicare. For frequent fliers, choosing regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance policy that covers emergency care in foreign countries may be a good bet. Similarly, people who spend part of the year in a different geographical area may find it difficult to stay in network for medical care and might be better off with regular Medicare and a Medigap insurance policy.
Your Health
People with chronic diseases and those who develop a serious health condition should look deeper into the choices available. A Medicare Advantage plan may be a better choice if it has an out-of-pocket maximum that protects you from huge bills. Regular Medicare plus a Medigap insurance plan generally allows you more choice in where you receive your care. Check whether any expensive drugs or equipment (such as supplies for people with diabetes) will be covered by your Medicare prescription drug plan, whether it's a stand-alone one or part of a Medicare Advantage plan.
Broader Benefits
Medicare Advantage plans are in the throes of change as the government allows insurers to add coverage for items that are not included in regular Medicare. These include such things as supplying food for service animals; paying for ramps for wheelchairs, hold bars, and indoor air quality monitors; adult day care; and residential and in-home respite care. Many of these benefits are just being initiated, so it pays to reconsider your choice of regular Medicare vs. Medicare Advantage each year during open enrollment to make sure you’re getting the benefits you need most, whether it's home care or transportation to doctors.
Can You Switch? Yes, But There’s a Catch
It’s logical to consider enjoying the cost savings of a Medicare Advantage plan while you’re relatively healthy, and then switching back to regular Medicare if you develop a condition you want treated at an out-of-town facility. In fact, switching between the two forms of Medicare (or between Medicare Advantage plans) is an option for everyone during the open enrollment period in the fall. This Annual Election Period runs from October 15 - December 7 each year.
Here’s the catch. If you switch back to regular Medicare (Part A and Part B), you may not be able to sign up for a Medigap insurance policy. When you first sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B, Medigap insurance companies are generally obligated to sell you a policy, regardless of your medical condition. But in subsequent years they may have the right to charge you extra due to your age and preexisting conditions, or not to sell you a policy at all if you have serious medical problems. Some states have enacted laws to address this. In New York and Connecticut, for example, Medigap insurance plans are guaranteed-issue year-round, while California, Massachusetts, Maine, Missouri, and Oregon have all set aside annual periods in which switching is allowed. If you live in a state that doesn't have this protection, planning to switch between the systems depending on your health condition is a risky business.
The CARES Act of 2020
On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package, called the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act, into law. It expands Medicare's ability to cover treatment and services for those affected by COVID-19. The CARES Act also:
- Increases flexibility for Medicare to cover telehealth services.
- Authorizes Medicare certification for home health services by physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse specialists.
- Increases Medicare payments for COVID-19-related hospital stays and durable medical equipment.
For Medicaid, the CARES Act clarifies that non-expansion states can use the Medicaid program to cover COVID-19-related services for uninsured adults who would have qualified for Medicaid if the state had chosen to expand. Other populations with limited Medicaid coverage are also eligible for coverage under this state option.",medicare supplement insurance,8

Compare Medicare Supplement Plans
When can I get a Medicare Supplement plan?
Your Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period (OEP) begins the first day of the month in which you are at least 65 and covered under Medicare Part B. You have six months to buy a Medicare Supplement insurance plan when the company is required to sell it to you. If you wait until after your OEP, you can apply anytime you want, but a plan could reject you or charge you more if you have health problems.
There may be other times after your OEP when you have “guaranteed-issue rights” to a Medicare Supplement plan.
For example, say you sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan. (Medicare Supplement plans don’t work with Medicare Advantage plans.)
- Suppose you decide to drop the Medicare Advantage plan and return to Original Medicare.
- Suppose it has been a year or less since you signed up for the Medicare Advantage plan.
- You have a right to buy a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan.
- Your “guaranteed issue rights” to a Medigap plan only apply to certain plans.
Medicare Supplement coverage of pre-existing conditions
Medicare Part A and Part B typically cover pre-existing conditions. The same goes for Medicare Supplement insurance. The difference is, a company may be able to refuse to sell you a Medicare Supplement plan in the first place in some cases.
As long as you buy a Medicare Supplement plan during the six-month Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period, the insurance company cannot refuse to sell you a plan. The insurance company also can’t charge you more because you have health problems or make you wait for basic benefits to begin.
However, you may have to wait up to six months for the Medicare Supplement policy’s benefits to include your pre-existing condition*.
If you apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan outside of your Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period, the private insurance company may “underwrite” the plan.
Underwriting the plan means that you may be subject to a physical exam, and the insurance company can refuse to sell you the plan or they can adjust your premium based on your health status.
Shop Medicare Supplement Insurance Plans
How insurance companies set Medigap premiums
There are three ways that an insurance company can set Medigap premium rates for Medicare Supplement plans:
- “Community-rated” (or “no-age-rated”) premiums are the same for everyone, regardless of age.
- “Issue-age-rated” (or “entry-age-rated”) premiums are based on your age when you first buy the policy. The sooner you buy, the less you will pay.
- “Attained-age-rated” premiums are based on your current age, meaning it goes up as you grow older.
Other factors impacting the premium rates of Medicare Supplement plans can include inflation, geography, medical underwriting (if you did not buy a plan when first eligible), and other discounts.
You should check with each specific health insurer to see how it sets Medigap prices before you buy.
*Pre-existing conditions are generally health conditions that existed before the start of a policy. They may limit coverage, be excluded from coverage, or even prevent you from being approved for a policy; however, the exact definition and relevant limitations or exclusions of coverage will vary with each plan, so check a specific plan’s official plan documents to understand how that plan handles pre-existing conditions.
